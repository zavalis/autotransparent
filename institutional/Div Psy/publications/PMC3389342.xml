                <p>Prospective negative cognitions are suggested to play an important role in maintaining anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about positive prospective mental imagery. This study investigated differences in prospective mental imagery among 27 patients with anxiety disorders, 24 patients with MDD, and 32 control participants. Measures of both deliberately generated and intrusive imagery were completed. Results indicated that both patients with anxiety disorders and those with MDD provided poorer vividness ratings for deliberately generated prospective positive scenarios compared to the control group. Patients with anxiety disorders showed a greater ability to vividly generate imagery for prospective negative scenarios than both patients with MDD and control participants. Finally, both clinical groups reported greater levels of intrusive prospective imagery of personally-relevant events as compared to the control group. The current findings underline the necessity to target prospective positive mental imagery in treating MDD and anxiety disorders.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>An extensive body of research has demonstrated support for cognitive theories indicating that cognitions can play a significant role in the development and maintenance of major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (<xref rid="bib0045 bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al., 2009; Gotlib &amp; Joormann, 2010</xref>). Cognitions are conceptualized as taking the form of verbal thoughts or mental images (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Beck, 1976</xref>) although the focus has traditionally been on verbal thoughts. In both depression and anxiety, faulty cognitive processes include difficulties in shifting attention from negative material and biases in memory, although there may be some differences between the two clinical syndromes with regard to these cognitive processes (<xref rid="bib0045 bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al., 2009; Gotlib &amp; Joormann, 2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>Cognitive biases as seen in depression and anxiety are likely to not only affect the processing of current and past experiences, but also the processing of prospective-oriented material, i.e., cognitions relating to the future. There is accumulating evidence that the same neural pathways are activated when imagining the future as when remembering the past (<xref rid="bib0025 bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Byrne, Becker, &amp; Burgess, 2007; Schacter, Addis, &amp; Buckner, 2007</xref>). According to the concept of the “prospective brain” (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2007</xref>), our ability to imagine and predict potential future events is based on stored information in our memory. In line with this model and given the fact that depression is associated with biases in the processing of both positive and negative memories (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Gotlib &amp; Joormann, 2010</xref>), one would expect depression to be associated with a bias in the processing of both positive and negative prospective-oriented material. Research on possible memory biases in anxiety has yielded mixed findings (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Craske et al., 2009</xref>), thus prohibiting clear predictions with regard to prospective-oriented information processing in this disorder.</p>
              <p>With regard to prospective positive and negative cognitions in depression and anxiety, <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod, Tata, Kentish, and Jacobsen (1997)</xref> have hypothesized that prospective cognitions may follow the same pattern as positive and negative affect as postulated by the tripartite model (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>). The tripartite model proposes that negative affect is shared by both depression and anxiety, whereas absence of positive affect is specific to depression. In this model, positive affect is seen as a dimension of pleasurable engagement, level of energy and concentration, whereas negative affect is thought of as a dimension of unpleasurable engagement and subjective distress. These dimensions are theorized to include broad affective, cognitive, and motivational characteristics (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>). <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod and Byrne (1996)</xref> and <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al. (1997)</xref> argue that affect is directly related to cognition and that positive and negative future-related cognitions may best be perceived as two separate dimensions of experience, differentially associated with depression and anxiety. Consequently, as depression is associated with increased negative affect and reduced positive affect it is also expected to be related to increased negative expectancies and decreased positive expectancies. In contrast, anxiety should only be associated with increased negative expectancies through the high negative affect component.</p>
              <p>Research into prospective mental imagery has taken two main approaches. The first is the examination of the <italic>deliberate</italic> (as opposed to involuntary) generation of specific prospective images in response to set cues such as short sentences in the laboratory. <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Macleod, Rose, and Williams (1993)</xref> used an adaptation of the Autobiographical Memory Task (typically used to study overgeneral past memory in depression) where participants are required to generate as many positive and negative future events as possible. In this adapted fluency measure of future thinking, participants are presented specific time periods in the future and asked to generate experiences they are looking forward to and not looking forward to, for example, next year or in five years time. Time periods are presented verbally, one at a time, and participants are given a time limit of one minute to generate and say aloud as many responses as they can. The items generated by participants are written down by the researcher. An example of a deliberately generated positive future event reported by participants might be “taking a vacation,” whereas an example of a negative future event might be “getting a disease.” Although deliberately generated in the laboratory, these same events may also be experienced as involuntary future images. Number of responses generated per condition (i.e., future positive experiences <italic>vs.</italic> future negative experiences) counts as the outcome measure. <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Macleod et al. (1993)</xref> have found this fluency measure of future thinking to be effective in eliciting personally relevant responses. In a study with suicidal patients and nondepressed controls, <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al. (1996)</xref> reported that deficits in being able to recall specific past memories were associated with deficits in generating specific future images. <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod and Byrne (1996)</xref> further found that both anxious and anxious-depressed participants showed greater anticipation of negative experiences that might happen to them in the future than the control group using this task. Furthermore, as expected, only anxious-depressed participants showed lower anticipation of positive future-directed experiences. In a study investigating clinical depression and anxiety, <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al. (1997)</xref> found that participants with depression generated less positive prospective experiences than control participants. However, contrary to their expectations and contrary to the tripartite model, participants with anxiety (i.e., not those with depression) generated a greater number of prospective negative experiences compared to controls.</p>
              <p>An alternative to the assessment of fluency has been to assess the vividness of imagery for prospective events generated in response to a set list. Using the Prospective Imagery Task (based on <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996</xref>), <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Stöber (2000)</xref> investigated the vividness of prospective positive and negative mental imagery in non-clinical anxiety and depression. Examples from this set list are “you will do well on your course” for a positive prospective event or “you will be a victim of a crime” for a negative prospective event. In this study by Stöber, only depression (and not anxiety) showed a unique relationship with impoverished vividness of positive prospective events. Furthermore, only anxiety (and not depressed mood) was correlated with enhanced imagery for negative prospective events. Using the same measurement of the vividness of prospective events in a study with non-clinical participants with high or low levels of dysphoria (depressed mood), <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Geddes, Colom, and Goodwin (2008)</xref> reported that high levels of dysphoria were associated with lower vividness of positive (but not negative) prospective images. These findings are also contrary to predictions based on the tripartite model or the model of the prospective brain. Taken together, predictions based on the tripartide model (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>) and the model of the “prospective brain” (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2007</xref>) have not entirely been able to explain the association between prospective imagery and depression and anxiety. In accordance with these two models, MDD has indeed been associated with lower vividness of positive prospective events (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, Moulds, &amp; Steele, 2008</xref><xref rid="bib0165 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">; MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>). Further, several studies have reported that anxiety is associated with a higher vividness of negative prospective images (<xref rid="bib0165 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>). However, contrary to predictions based on the models, several studies have reported that MDD is not related to higher vividness of negative prospective images (<xref rid="bib0120 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al., 2008; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>).</p>
              <p>The second approach has been to explore <italic>intrusive</italic> involuntary prospective imagery for real-world events, i.e., images of the future which come to mind unbidden rather than those generated in response to set cues in the laboratory as in the studies discussed above. The Impact of Future Events Scale (IFES; <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose &amp; Holmes, 2010</xref>) was designed to measure the impact of “pre-experiencing” in the form of intrusive prospective, personally-relevant imagery, assessed through a series of self-report questions. A positive correlation between current depressive symptomatology and IFES Total Score has been observed in a non-clinical sample, with a mild-dysphoric group showing significantly higher Total IFES scores than a non-dysphoric group (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose &amp; Holmes, 2010</xref>). Total IFES score has also been associated with risk for bipolar disorder in a non-clinical sample (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose, Malik, &amp; Holmes, 2011</xref>). These results raise the possibility that intrusive prospective imagery may be of relevance in depression as well as anxiety.</p>
              <p>A growing body of recent research has documented the association between imagery and mental disorders (<xref rid="bib0015 bib0090 bib0110 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, &amp; Burgess, 2010; Hirsch &amp; Holmes, 2007; Holmes &amp; Hackmann, 2004; Holmes &amp; Mathews, 2010</xref>). Mental imagery has been shown to evoke greater emotional responses than language-based representations (<xref rid="bib0125 bib0130 bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah, 2009; Holmes &amp; Mathews, 2010; Holmes, Mathews, Mackintosh, &amp; Dalgleish, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, research suggests that prospective imagery affects future behavior. <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Libby, Shaeffer, Eibach, and Slemmer (2007)</xref> as well as <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Vasquez and Buehler (2007)</xref> have demonstrated that people are more motivated to accomplish future behavior and also to actually conduct the behavior in question if they imagine its successful completion from a third-person perspective rather than a first-person perspective. <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Crane, Fennell, and Williams (2007)</xref> have shown that simulation of future events using imagery may be particularly concerning from a clinical perspective if the action is negative, such as in the case of “suicidal flashforwards” imagery (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Crane, Shah, Barnhofer, &amp; Holmes, in press</xref>).</p>
              <p>The aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between positive and negative prospective mental imagery in patients with MDD and patients with anxiety disorders in comparison to healthy participants using established paradigms from experimental psychopathology research. First, we assessed vividness for <italic>deliberately</italic> generated mental images in response to a set list of prospective positive and negative events using the Prospective Imagery Task (<xref rid="bib0120 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al., 2008; Stöber, 2000</xref>). Ratings were also obtained for arousal as well as the estimated likelihood that each event would occur in the future. Second, we investigated the impact of <italic>intrusive</italic>, prospective imagery of personally-relevant real-world events among patients with MDD and anxiety and in comparison to healthy participants using the IFES (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose &amp; Holmes, 2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>In accordance with findings reported above (<xref rid="bib0120 bib0165 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al., 2008; MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>), we predicted that for deliberately generated images, only participants with MDD (i.e., and not those with anxiety disorders) would report lower vividness of positive prospective images as compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, we predicted that only participants with anxiety disorders (i.e., and not those with MDD) would report higher vividness of negative prospective images than healthy participants (<xref rid="bib0120 bib0165 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al., 2008; MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>).

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>The samples consisted of 24 patients with MDD, 27 patients with anxiety disorders, and 32 healthy control participants. Patients with MDD or anxiety disorders were recruited from outpatient psychiatric clinics of the University of Frankfurt. Diagnoses were determined by qualified clinicians using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis for I disorders (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1996</xref>) and Axis II disorders (<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Pfohl, Blum, &amp; Zimmerman, 1997</xref>). The SCID was used in assessing the clinical groups only. Patients were included if they met criteria for MDD or at least one anxiety disorder. Exclusion criteria were acute suicidality, depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms, bipolar disorder, organic psychiatric disorders, substance-abuse disorders, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, and borderline personality disorder. An additional exclusion criterion for the group with anxiety disorders was meeting criteria for MDD. On the other hand, anxiety disorders were an exclusion criterion for the MDD group.</p>
                <p>In the MDD group, 70.8% of the participants were diagnosed with MDD as the only diagnosis. The rest of the sample had one comorbid diagnosis (three patients were diagnosed with a comorbid somatization disorder, two with a comorbid pain disorder, one with bulimia nervosa, and one with an avoidant personality disorder). Participants with MDD had a mean age of 42.0 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.3) and 58.3% of them were female.</p>
                <p>In the group of anxiety disorders, participants were diagnosed with the following primary diagnoses: panic disorder with (14.8%) or without (33.3%) agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder (22.2%), social phobia (7.4%), posttraumatic stress disorder (7.4%), agoraphobia (3.7%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (3.7%), and specific phobia (7.4%). The majority of participants (66.7%) had no comorbid disorder. Participants with a comorbid disorder were diagnosed with either another anxiety disorder (22.2% of the total sample) or another comorbid diagnosis (11.1% of the total sample: one with bulimia nervosa, one with hypochondriasis, and one with narcissistic personality disorder). The mean age of participants in the anxiety group was 35.1 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.6) and 74.1% were female.</p>
                <p>Individuals in the control group were recruited through advertisement and were matched to the patient groups with respect to age and gender. Potential control participants were included after having been screened with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983</xref>) and provided that they had no prior history of MDD or anxiety disorders. Within this sample, the average age was 38.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.1) and the percentage of female participants was 62.5%.</p>
                <p>This study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University of Frankfurt. Written informed consent was provided by all participants.</p>

                <title>Measures</title>
                <p>The <italic>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</italic> (HADS) (<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983</xref>) was used to assess anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items). Authors of the HADS have recommended a score of above 10 for probable clinical anxiety or depressive disturbance, respectively. The HADS has demonstrated good reliability and validity properties (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann, 1997</xref>). In the current study, the internal consistency reliability of the HADS anxiety subscale (<italic>α</italic> = 0.85) and depression subscale (<italic>α</italic> = 0.88) were satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The <italic>Prospective Imagery Task</italic> (PIT; based on <xref rid="bib0165 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; Stöber, 2000</xref>) was used to measure imagery for 10 positive and 10 negative prospective events. As in <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al. (2008)</xref>, subjects were asked to rate the vividness of prospective positive events (e.g., “You will have lots of energy and enthusiasm”) or negative events (e.g., “Someone close to you will reject you”) on a 5-point scale (1 = no image at all; 5 = very vivid). However, in addition to the vividness, in the current study, the PIT was modified to also include arousal associated with prospective images and the estimated likelihood that prospective images will occur in the future. Levels of emotional arousal were assessed in line with the study's focus on emotional disorder in order to explore whether participants in the clinical groups would report higher levels of emotional arousal associated with the vividness of positive or negative prospective imagery compared to controls, with whom the measure has been predominately utilized. Participants were first instructed to read a particular future scenario (e.g., “Someone close will reject you”) and to imagine the scenario happening to them. Then they were asked to rate the vividness of the scenario in question (“How vividly can you imagine this scenario?”). Then, they were asked to rate the arousal associated with each the scenario in question (“How emotionally aroused do you feel while having this image”). Finally they were asked to calculate how likely it is that that particular scenario might occur in future (“How likely is it that this scenario might happen to you in the future”). Rates of arousal and estimated likelihood were also rated on a 5-point scale. In the current study, the internal consistency of the PIT positive subscale was <italic>α</italic> = 0.89 for the measurement of vividness, <italic>α</italic> = 0.87 for the measurement of arousal, and <italic>α</italic> = 0.89 for the measurement of likelihood. The internal consistency of the PIT negative subscale was <italic>α</italic> = 0.83 for the measurement of vividness, <italic>α</italic> = 0.87 for the measurement of arousal, and <italic>α</italic> = 0.84 for the measurement of likelihood.</p>
                <p>The <italic>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</italic> (PANAS) (<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>) was administered to separately measure both positive and negative affect. In the current study, the short version of the PANAS consisting of five items for positive affect and five items for negative affect was used (<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Thompson, 2007</xref>). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> (1) to <italic>extremely</italic> (5). Participants were asked to anchor their responses to feelings during the last two months. The internal consistency reliability in the current study was <italic>α</italic> = 0.81 for the subscale of positive affect and <italic>α</italic> = 0.84 for the subscale of negative affect.</p>
                <p>The <italic>Impact of Future Event Scale</italic> (IFES) (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose &amp; Holmes, 2010</xref>) was used to assess the impact of intrusive prospective, personally-relevant imagery. To encourage participants to respond on IFES in relation to idiosyncratic future events, participants were first asked “Please identify three future events which you have been thinking about by imagining over the past seven days (e.g., positive or stressful life events). For each event, please indicate whether your imagining of it was positive or negative.” Thus, participants could respond with solely positive or solely negative events, or a combination of both. Participants then responded to 24-items with the instructions “Below is a list of comments made by people about imagining events in the future. Please read each item, indicating how frequently each comment was true for you during the past 7 days due to imagining the future”. Items included “Pictures about the future popped into my mind,” “I tried not to think about the future” and “I had waves of strong feelings about the future.” Each item was anchored on a 5-point scale.</p>
                <p>In scoring the IFES, the primary outcome variable is IFES Total Score which is the summation of responses to the 24-items. The secondary outcome variable is the number of negative events per individual, which is summed to create “IFES Negative Events”, i.e., the total number of events rated by the participant as negative. The total number of events provided by each participant is three. IFES has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87) and adequate test re-test reliability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.73) (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2011</xref>). The internal consistency of the IFES in the current study was <italic>α</italic> = 0.90.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To date little research has examined prospective mental imagery in anxiety and depression, despite its clinical relevance to cognitive behavioral formulations of these disorders. In line with our predictions, we showed first that depressed patients, compared to controls, had impoverished imagery vividness when asked to deliberately imagine positive future events. This finding is clinically compelling as it suggests even if depressed people are asked to try to imagine a positive future, it is seen less clearly.</p>
              <p>Second, as predicted results showed that patients with anxiety disorders (and not those with depression) imagined negative prospective images more vividly than the healthy participants. This is consistent with clinical reports by anxious patients being assailed by vivid imagined future threats. Importantly, this suggests that if given a trigger, such as a negative warning in a newspaper, people with anxiety would be susceptible to seeing the worst outcome more clearly and intensely than non-anxious individuals.</p>
              <p>Our final key finding concerned intrusive, involuntary personal imagery rather than deliberate imagery. As predicted, data revealed that both patients with anxiety and depression reported a higher impact of <italic>intrusive</italic>, involuntary prospective images of personal events than the control group. This suggests that patients experiencing both disorders are more prone to unwanted images of events in the future springing to mind unbidden.</p>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of mental imagery in prospective cognition using a convergent battery of measures to examine both deliberately generated and intrusive real-world mental imagery in clinical samples of MDD and anxiety disorders. A further strength is the use of age and gender-matched controls. However, the study has also several limitations. The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for conclusions of causal relations between depression and anxiety and prospective mental imagery. The anxiety disorder sample was composed of patients with different anxiety disorders. However, there may be differences between individuals with different anxiety disorders with respect to prospective imagery. Future studies are needed to examine this issue. Further, no inter-rater reliability regarding the use of the SCID was assessed though all interviewers were conducted by qualified clinicians. Finally, use of medication at the time of assessment was not assessed and thus it could not be measured whether medication might have influenced prospective cognitions. Future studies may wish to select a wider range of imagery measures, including laboratory based tasks rather than questionnaire measures and also measure whether psychopfarmaca influences prospective cognitions.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, these findings offer new insight into the potential role of mental imagery in prospective cognition in patients with MDD or anxiety disorders. As in prior research (<xref rid="bib0120 bib0165 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al., 2008; MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>), patients with MDD reported lower scores for vividness of prospective positive scenarios than control participants. Furthermore, patients with MDD did not report higher vividness of negative prospective images than control participants, also a finding consistent with previous literature (<xref rid="bib0120 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, et al., 2008; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>) and in contradiction with predictions based on the tripartite model (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>) or the current conceptualization of the prospective brain (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2007</xref>). However, it has been reported that observer-perspective images are common in individuals with MDD (<xref rid="bib0145 bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Kuyken &amp; Howell, 2006; Moulds &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>). Based on findings that observer-perspective is associated with reduced emotional arousal (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Holmes &amp; Mathews, 2010</xref>), it might be that in our study patients with MDD may have used observer-perspective more often than patients with anxiety disorders and thus have damped vividness of negative events. Yet, future research should test this hypothesis while looking at perspective in relation to prospective images among patients with MDD and anxiety disorders.</p>
              <p>Our result that patients with anxiety disorders reported more vivid images of negative prospective events than healthy participants is also in line with prior studies (<xref rid="bib0165 bib0175 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod &amp; Byrne, 1996; MacLeod et al., 1997; Stöber, 2000</xref>). However, the outcome that patients with anxiety disorders also reported impoverished vividness of positive prospective events is seemingly contradictory to previous results. <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod and Byrne (1996)</xref>, <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al. (1997)</xref> and <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Stöber (2000)</xref> found that anxious participants did not show lower levels of positive future experiences. However, as mentioned above, the fluency measure of prospective thinking as utilized by <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod and Byrne (1996)</xref> and the PIT used here are intended to measure different outcomes (fluency, i.e., number of prospective events <italic>vs.</italic> vividness of prospective scenarios). Thus, our findings can rather be seen as an assessment of another dimension of prospective cognitions (i.e., imagery rather than just verbal thought). Although we used the same measure of prospective imagery as <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Stöber (2000)</xref> we studied a clinical sample compared to the non-clinical analogue population used previously which may account for the disparity in results. Finally, the difference with regard to positive prospective images remained significant between patients with anxiety disorders and healthy participants even after controlling for current depression symptomatology.</p>
              <p>Our exploratory examination of the arousal of generating imagery on the PIT did not reveal any differences between clinical groups and controls with regard to positive prospective images. Further, patients with anxiety disorders reported significantly higher levels of arousal associated with negative prospective cognitions than control participants. This indicates that impoverished vividness of positive prospective images is not related to reduced emotional arousal associated with these images. However, enhanced vividness of negative prospective images was related to enhanced emotional arousal. Patients with anxiety disorders who reported enhanced levels of vividness of negative images than controls also reported higher levels of emotional arousal associated with these images than controls. The estimated likelihood that prospective images will occur in the future was associated with levels of both positive and negative prospective images. Both patients with MDD and anxiety disorders rated the likelihood of occurrence of positive prospective events as less likely than the control group as they also rated impoverished vividness of these prospective events than controls. Similarly, patients with anxiety disorders rated negative prospective events as more likely than controls. These results are in line with previous related finding. <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Warren, Zgourides, and Jones (1989)</xref> reported that perceived likelihood of negative outcomes predicted avoidance behavior in patients with anxiety disorders. <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod et al. (2005)</xref> found that perceived likelihood of positive events was associated with levels of hopelessness. <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Vincent, Boddana, and MacLeod (2004)</xref> reported that parasuicide patients estimated personal goals as less likely to be attained.</p>
              <p>Our findings underscore implications for cognitive theory and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) of depression and anxiety regarding mental imagery. First, if a deficit in positive imagery is a deficit, a clinical implication might be promoting stronger deliberate positive imagery of the future may be of benefit in depression and anxiety disorders (<xref rid="bib0080 bib0115 bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Hackmann, Bennett-Levy, &amp; Holmes, 2011; Holmes, Lang, &amp; Deeprose, 2009; Holmes, Mathews, Dalgleish, &amp; Mackintosh, 2006</xref>). As this was not an intervention-based study, we did not assess the impact of promoting deliberate positive imagery per se, but our findings suggest that future research in this area would be fruitful (<xref rid="bib0010 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &amp; Holmes, 2010; Lang, Blackwell, Hamer, Davison, &amp; Holmes, submitted for publication</xref>). Positive imagery can be boosted in a number of ways from imagery work developing an idiosyncratic and positive image (e.g., one image of a positive self-nurturer in compassionate mind work <xref rid="bib0070 bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert &amp; Irons, 2004; Lee, 2005</xref>) to encouraging systematic training to be able to better imagine numerous positive future events (<xref rid="bib0010 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell &amp; Holmes, 2010; Lang et al., submitted for publication</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our results indicate that deliberately generated prospective negative images may be more closely related to anxiety than to depression but that both MDD and anxiety may be associated with intrusive prospective imagery of real-world events. While intrusive negative imagery has long been described in anxiety (<xref rid="bib0090 bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch &amp; Holmes, 2007; Holmes &amp; Hackmann, 2004</xref>), intrusive negative imagery has only more recently been described as a clinical feature in depression (<xref rid="bib0200 bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2007; Williams &amp; Moulds, 2007</xref>). Targeting negative intrusive imagery in depression in the way it is targeted in anxiety may open new treatment options (<xref rid="bib0020 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Brewin et al., 2009; Kandris &amp; Moulds, 2008</xref>). Techniques that could be used to target negative imagery include imagery rescripting (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Arntz, &amp; Smucker, 2007</xref>) as well as simple exposure (<xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Kandris &amp; Moulds, 2008</xref>). Targeting negative imagery has already been pivotal in the development of (CBT) for post-traumatic stress disorder where individual hotspots and flashbacks are a focus (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>) and social phobia which included behavioral experiments to challenge socially phobic imagery (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2006</xref>). This targeting of negative imagery may usefully be extended to mood disorders (<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Geddes, Colom, &amp; Goodwin, 2008</xref>). Further, boosting positive imagery of the future provides a novel experimentally driven target for treatment innovation in depression.</p>
