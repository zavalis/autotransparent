              <abstract>
                <p>The lateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices have both been implicated in emotion regulation, but their distinct roles in regulation of negative emotion remain poorly understood. To address this issue we enrolled 58 participants in an fMRI study in which participants were instructed to reappraise both negative and neutral stimuli. This design allowed us to separately study activations reflecting cognitive processes associated with reappraisal in general and activations specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Our results confirmed that both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contribute to emotion regulation through reappraisal. However, activity in the DLPFC was related to reappraisal independently of whether negative or neutral stimuli were reappraised, whereas the lateral OFC was uniquely related to reappraisal of negative stimuli. We suggest that relative to the lateral OFC, the DLPFC serves a more general role in emotion regulation, perhaps by reflecting the cognitive demand that is inherent to the regulation task.</p>

              <p>The capacity to regulate the generation, experience and expression of emotion is a central aspect of mental health <xref rid="pone.0048107-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Indeed, emotion dysregulation is a common feature of psychiatric illness, and particularly of depressive and anxiety disorders <xref rid="pone.0048107-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The clinical implications of emotional regulation have promoted a growing interest in understanding the neural aspects of emotion regulation. Available data suggest that emotion regulation is accomplished through the interaction between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) – involved in control processes – and subcortical structures, such as the amygdala, involved in the generation of emotions <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Instruction-induced reappraisal of an emotionally salient stimulus is the most extensively studied form of cognitive emotion regulation. During reappraisal, cognitive strategies are used to reinterpret the meaning of an emotion-eliciting stimulus in terms of a non-emotional event thereby attenuating automatic emotional responses <xref rid="pone.0048107-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Neuroimaging studies of reappraisal collectively suggest that efforts to reappraise an emotional stimulus activate wide areas of the PFC, including ventrolateral, ventromedial, dorsolateral and dorsomedial regions <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0048107-Urry2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The variety of PFC regions implicated in these past studies is likely to reflect important differences in specific experimental manipulations <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kalisch1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The basic rationale underlying reappraisal paradigms is that the emotion regulatory processes can be isolated by subtracting the effect of prototypical attend trials, during which subjects passively view negative pictures, from reappraise trials when subjects engage in a cognitively demanding emotional regulation task <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the direct comparison between attend and reappraise trials does not allow for a differentiation of activations due to emotion regulation <italic>per se</italic> and activations reflecting the recruitment of networks that are shared between different cognitive regulation processes more generally. Although previous research confirms that such a general network of cognitive control <xref rid="pone.0048107-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> are likely to be important in emotion regulation, the question remains open whether there are regions in the brain that that are uniquely related to attempts at regulating negative emotion. In fact, consistent with the notion of a general cognitive control network <xref rid="pone.0048107-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, previous studies of reappraisal commonly report activations of areas that are shared with those reported from studies of the cognitive control of other mental processes, such as memory and attention <xref rid="pone.0048107-Badre1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0048107-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Specifically, the consistent recruitment of DLPFC during reappraisal <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kalisch1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> may reflect a more general role of this area in maintaining and representing the attentional demands of the task <xref rid="pone.0048107-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and in monitoring and manipulating information held in working memory <xref rid="pone.0048107-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0048107-Champod1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Because of the sparse connections between the DLPFC and the amygdala <xref rid="pone.0048107-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, this region is likely to influence the amygdala indirectly by modulating activity in other regions, such as perceptual areas in the parietal/occipital cortex or the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which are directly connected to the amygdala <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner4" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The lateral OFC is of particular interest, because it is critically involved in cognitive control functions, such as response inhibition and response selection <xref rid="pone.0048107-Badre1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Aron1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, as well as in various forms of cognitive emotion regulation <xref rid="pone.0048107-Cunningham1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0048107-Koenigsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and in particular reappraisal <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kanske1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, previous studies on reappraisal of negative affect have reported reappraisal-dependent coupling between the lateral OFC and the amygdala <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kanske1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and activity in the right lateral OFC has been identified as a core region mediating successful reappraisal of negative emotion <xref rid="pone.0048107-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Although there are other candidate regions with relevance for emotion regulation, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex <xref rid="pone.0048107-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Phelps1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, no study has so far addressed the relative contribution of the DLPFC and lateral OFC during reappraisal. In the present study, we tested the prediction that the DLPFC serves a more general cognitive control function in emotion regulation, whereas the lateral OFC is uniquely engaged in inhibition of negative emotions during an instruction-induced reappraisal task. To address this issue, we used a 2×2 factorial design crossing factors of instruction (reappraisal vs. no reappraisal) and stimulus valence (emotional vs. non-emotional). This design allowed us to separate activations related to general cognitive control processes (main effect of instruction) and those specifically devoted to the control of negative emotion (instruction × stimulus valence interaction), and has recently been used in other emotion regulation tasks such as during distancing <xref rid="pone.0048107-Koenigsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and detachment <xref rid="pone.0048107-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> from negative emotion. Thus, we hypothesized that the DLPFC would be activated across conditions requiring reappraisal (general contribution), whereas the OFC would be uniquely activated during conditions involving reappraisal of negative emotion (unique contribution).</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>Most previous studies on instruction-induced emotion regulation have typically excluded a control condition involving a regulation instruction preceding neutral picture trials. The basic rationale for this was described in an early emotional suppression study <xref rid="pone.0048107-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, in which participants reported confusion when instructed to suppress emotional reactions to neutral pictures. However, two more recent studies have reported successful compliance during regulation of neutral trials, using distancing <xref rid="pone.0048107-Koenigsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and detachment <xref rid="pone.0048107-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> as regulation instructions. Therefore, in the current study, we performed extensive pilot testing to confirm that participants could comply with the instructions Attend (i.e. “passively view the picture without trying to manipulate ongoing responses”) and Reappraise (i.e. “relate to the picture in non-emotional terms by reinterpreting the content of the picture so that it no longer elicits a response”) independently of whether they preceded neutral or negative trials. An example of an instruction that was given for Reappraise neutral trials was “even if you do not experience the picture to be very emotional, you should maintain the regulation instruction and reinterpret the meaning of the picture in order to further neutralize your experience of the picture”. Before beginning the experiment, all participants performed 12 practice trials that mirrored the experimental procedure, gave verbal confirmation on understanding how to comply with the instructions, and gave a short description of how they were to do so. No participants reported confusion about how to adopt a reappraisal strategy for the neutral and negative trials before or after completing the experimental task. The experiment consisted of four types of trials: 20 attend negative, 20 reappraise negative, 20 attend neutral and 20 reappraise neutral. Trial presentation was pseudo-randomized with no more than two consecutive trials of the same condition. On each trial, participants were given a 2 s written instruction on the screen (attend/reappraise) after which they viewed a picture (negative/neutral) for 5 s. After each picture viewing phase, subjects rated their current level of discomfort on a scale ranging from 1 to 7, on which 1 = minimal or no discomfort and 7 = maximal discomfort. This was done in order to assess the affective experience of the participant after completing each trial. Each trial ended with the presentation of a fixation cross that was jittered 3–5 s between trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048107-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Ratings were performed on a MRI-compatible joystick (Mag Design and Engineering Sunnyvale, CA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.magconcept.com">www.magconcept.com</ext-link>).</p>

After each picture viewing phase, participants indicated their current level of discomfort on a scale from 1 to 7 (1 = minimal or no discomfort, 7 = maximum discomfort). Each trial ended with a fixation cross jittered between trials with a duration of 3–5 seconds.</p>

                <p>An anatomical scan and fMRI data were obtained using a GE Sigma Echo Speed 1.5 T scanner and an 8-channel head-coil. Functional scans were obtained using a gradient echo sequence T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging (EPI) scan (TR = 2.5 sec, TE = 40 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees, 32 axial slices in ascending order (thickness = 3 mm with 1 mm gap) and a field of view (FOV) = 22 cm×22 cm, matrix size = 64×64). The first ten scans were defined as dummy scans to allow for longitudinal T1-equilibrization and these were not included in the analysis. Functional image acquisition was divided into 2 runs of 245 volumes with a break of approximately 20–30 sec between the runs. A T1-weighted structural image (3D-SPGR) was also collected at the end of the experiment.</p>

                <title>Image Preprocessing and Analysis</title>
                <p>All imaging data were analyzed with SPM8 (Statistical parametric mapping, The Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London) running on Matlab20010a (MathWorks, Natick, MA). For each subject, individual images were first slice-time corrected to adjust for acquisition time differences between the slices and realigned to the first volume to correct for head movement. The T1-weighted image was then co-registered with the mean EPI image and subsequently segmented using the unified segmentation approach as implemented in the “New Segment” routine in SPM8 to generate gray and white matter images. These images were then used within the DARTEL toolbox to create structural templates across subjects as well as individual flow fields that were then used to spatially normalize the EPI images into MNI space. Finally, all images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm and temporally high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 128 to remove low-frequency drifts.</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis was performed using standard procedures for fMRI involving a fixed effect model at the single-subject level and a random effects model at the group level <xref rid="pone.0048107-Friston1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For each participant, boxcar regressors representing the 5 s duration of each condition (Reappraise negative, Attend negative, Reappraise neutral, Attend neutral) was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and subsequently entered into a general linear model as implemented in SPM. Realignment parameters were included as regressors of no interest to account for variance related to movement. In a second level random effects group analysis, we specified a 2 (Instruction) × 2 (Valence) within-subject ANOVA with non-sphericity correction using the flexible factorial option in SPM8.</p>
                <p>Given the role of the amygdala in emotional processing <xref rid="pone.0048107-Phelps2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and that this region has been shown to be modulated by reappraisal <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, we defined the amygdala as an a priori region of interest (ROI). To confirm that our task successfully engaged the amygdala, we looked at the main effect of Valence (Attend negative + Reappraise negative &gt; Attend neutral + Reappraise neutral). The ROI was created around the right and left amygdala using the automated anatomical labels of the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas toolbox <xref rid="pone.0048107-Maldjian1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Activation within the ROI was considered significant at p&lt;.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected together with a 10 voxel cluster threshold. To investigate activations that were related to the reappraisal instruction in general, we looked at the main effect of Instruction (Reappraise negative + Reappraise neutral &gt; Attend negative + Attend neutral). Finally, to address activations that were specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion, we looked at the Instruction × Valence interaction given by the interaction term Reappraise (negative- neutral) &gt; Attend (negative – neutral). Given our a priori hypothesis regarding the contributions of the DLPFC and the lateral OFC in emotion regulation, these regions were predefined as ROIs (DLPFC = middle frontal gyrus; lateral OFC = inferior and middle orbital gyri) using the automated anatomical labels of the Wake Forest University (WFU) PickAtlas toolbox <xref rid="pone.0048107-Maldjian1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

                <title>Behavioral Ratings</title>
                <p>To index whether the images were experienced as less negative after regulation, participants were instructed to rate their current level of discomfort after each picture-viewing phase. As expected, discomfort ratings were lower on Reappraise than on Attend trials both for negative and neutral stimulus pictures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). A 2 (Instruction: reappraise vs. attend) × 2 (Valence: negative vs. neutral) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), resulted in significant main effects of Instruction <italic>F</italic>(1, 55) = 83.55, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001, η<sup>2</sup> = .60 and Valence <italic>F</italic>(1, 55) = 194.31, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001, η<sup>2</sup> = .78, as well as a significant Instruction × Valence interaction <italic>F</italic>(1, 55) = 60.22, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001, η<sup>2</sup> = .52. The reliable interaction was driven by significantly lower discomfort ratings on Reappraise (negative-neutral) than on Attend (negative–neutral) trials. To confirm this interpretation, we first subtracted ratings during the viewing of neutral pictures from ratings during the negative pictures for each instruction and then compared these difference terms, which resulted in a highly significant difference, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048107-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

                <title>Amygdala Activation</title>
                <p>First, to confirm that our experimental task effectively engaged the amygdala when participants were exposed to negative pictures, we looked at the main effect of Valence within the predefined amygdala ROI. As expected, the analysis revealed a significant bilateral amygdala activation in response to negative compared to neutral pictures (right amygdala: x = 20, y = −2, z = 18, <italic>T</italic> = 12.19, <italic>k</italic>

                <title>Main Effect of Instruction</title>
                <p>To test our hypothesis that activation in the DLPFC would be significantly related to the reappraisal instruction across picture valence, we first investigated the effect of the reappraisal instruction. In line with our hypothesis, the instruction to “Reappraise” compared to “Attend” resulted in significant activations only in the DLPFC ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048107-g003">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048107-t002">Table 2</xref>) but not in the lateral OFC ROI. A whole brain analysis revealed significant activation in a fronto-parietal attentional control network involving dominantly right-sided activations in DLPFC and inferior parietal lobe (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048107.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p>

                <p>To investigate the brain areas devoted to reappraisal of negative emotion when controlling for the main effect of instruction, we tested the effect of the Instruction × Valence interaction within the DLPFC and the lateral OFC ROIs This contrast revealed mainly bilateral activation in the lateral OFC and to smaller extent activation within the DLPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048107-g003">Fig. 3C and 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048107-t002">Table 2</xref>) A whole brain analysis did not reveal any additional prefrontal areas (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048107.s002">Table S2</xref>).</p>

                <p>To further investigate the Instruction × Valence interaction and in parallel to the results reported for the behavior data, we additionally ran one-sample t-tests comparing activations in Reappraise vs. Attend to neutral and negative trials separately within the DLPFC and lateral OFC ROIS. As predicted, whereas the DLPFC was significantly activated in both reappraisal contrasts irrespectively of whether reappraisal effort was targeted on negative (Reappraise negative &gt; Attend negative) or neutral stimuli (Reappraise neutral &gt; Attend neutral), the lateral OFC was uniquely activated during reappraisal of negative stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048107-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048107-t003">Table 3</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In line with our hypothesis regarding the distinct roles of the DLPFC and the lateral OFC in emotion regulation, our results showed that the DLPFC was activated across the reappraisal task irrespectively of whether the reappraisal effort was targeted on negative or neutral stimuli. In contrast, the lateral OFC was uniquely engaged during reappraisal of negative stimuli.</p>
              <p>First, our task resulted in larger amygdala responses to negative as compared to neutral stimuli, indicating that negative stimuli elicited a greater emotional response. Second, we demonstrated that reappraisal instructions resulted in down-regulation of the larger amygdala response to negative stimuli. In terms of brain regions activated during reappraisal, we found a main effect of the reappraisal task across stimulus valence that was restricted to the DLPFC and the inferior parietal cortex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0048107.s001">Table S1</xref>). By demonstrating robust activation in the fronto-parietal attentional control network, we showed that the effect of the regulation task across both negative and neutral stimulus overlapped with the effect commonly reported for the main emotion regulation contrast (i.e. Reappraise negative &gt; Attend negative) in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Levesque1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0048107-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Goldin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, the DLPFC was not uniquely related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Rather, the DLPFC was the only prefrontal region that was significantly activated during reappraisal of both negative and neutral stimuli. Critically, we identified voxels within the DLPFC that showed overlapping activity in both reappraisal conditions, indicating a general activation of this region during implementation of regulation. In light of the observed pattern of activity, we suggest that activity in the DLPFC reflects the effortful processing that accompanies reappraisal, perhaps by maintaining the attentional demands of the task. Although different cognitive processes may give rise to the same pattern of brain activation, our interpretation is consistent with previous research using other cognitive control tasks to demonstrate that DLPFC activity increases with increasing task load <xref rid="pone.0048107-Rypma1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and that activity within this region represents the active maintenance of task-related requirements for attentional control <xref rid="pone.0048107-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Assuming that activity in the DLPFC reflects cognitive processing that is inherent to the reappraisal task, it is therefore not surprising that activity within this region was observed across negative and neutral conditions involving the reappraisal instruction. Consequently, this gave rise to activation patterns that were shared with the lateral OFC, as was seen in activation in both regions during reappraisal of negative emotion. Importantly though, unlike the general recruitment of the DLPFC across reappraisal conditions, activity in the lateral OFC was uniquely observed during reappraisal of negative stimuli. The location and functional neuroanatomy of the OFC makes it ideally suited for suppressing neural activity in subcortical structures due to its rich reciprocal connectivity to both the PFC and emotion generating processing regions <xref rid="pone.0048107-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A comprehensive meta-analysis on the role of the OFC has suggested that subregions within this region serve functionally distinct roles <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kringelbach1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. According to this view, while activity in the medial region of the OFC is related to monitoring, learning and memory of the reward value of reinforcing stimuli, activity within the lateral regions of the OFC is more related to evaluation of punishers that can promote behavioral change <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kringelbach2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In line with a medial-lateral division within the OFC, previous reappraisal studies have demonstrated an association between increased medial OFC activity and reactivity to emotional material <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, whereas lateral OFC activity has been associated with down-regulation of emotional responses <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Phan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Koenigsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and a functional coupling with the amygdala during reappraisal <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kanske1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In fact, in a mediation analysis reported by Wager and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0048107-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, the lateral OFC was identified as a core region mediating reappraisal success through two independent subcortical pathways involving the nucleus accumbens that predicted successful reappraisal, and the amygdala, that predicted unsuccessful reappraisal. These results were interpreted to suggest that the lateral OFC is engaged both by a negative appraisal process that involves the amygdala, and a positive appraisal process involving the nucleus accumbens. As such, our results are supported by these data as they implicate the lateral OFC as critically involved in the regulation of emotion. Moreover, our results fits particularly well with a recent study <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kanske1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> that directly contrasted emotion regulation accomplished by two different regulation strategies and reported that the lateral OFC was specifically engaged by reappraisal as compared to when using the strategy of distancing. Importantly, the present results, which directly compared the relative contribution of the DLPFC and the lateral OFC during reappraisal, are consistent with the proposed role of these regions in other regulation tasks, such as during the regulation of pain <xref rid="pone.0048107-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Lesch1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0048107-Lieberman2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and selective attention <xref rid="pone.0048107-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Although our findings point to a specific contribution of the lateral OFC during down-regulation of negative emotion, previous studies have also implicated this region during regulation of positive emotion <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and during up-regulation of negative emotion (but see <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Eippert1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> for opposite findings). Nevertheless, directly contrasting specific aspects of emotion regulation, such as contrasting different regulation strategies <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kanske1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, down- and up-regulation of emotion <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Urry1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Eippert1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and regulation effort targeted on positive and negative emotion <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, represent related strategies to address the specific contributions of different prefrontal regions during emotion regulation.</p>
              <p>An important limitation of the present findings lies in the nature of the reappraisal task. Although widely used as model of instructed emotion regulation <xref rid="pone.0048107-Kalisch1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the task suffers from limited experimental control as there are no means by which it is possible to confirm exactly what is going on during the different instructions, or exactly what strategies are being employed at a given point in time. This matter is of particular relevance for the interpretation of the current findings, which rest on the assumption that participants could comply with the reappraisal instruction during both negative and neutral trials. As is the case with previous reappraisal studies <xref rid="pone.0048107-Ochsner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> successful compliance with the instructions can only be obtained by self-reports and subjective ratings after each trial, which are likely to be biased by experimental demands. In the present study, and in previous studies adopting a balanced design by crossing factors of Instruction (regulate vs. passive viewing) with Stimulus valence (negative vs. neutral) <xref rid="pone.0048107-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048107-Koenigsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, participants were asked to rate their response not only to negative, but also to neutral stimulus pictures, which might have introduced further complications <xref rid="pone.0048107-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. To make sure that our participants understood the rating procedure, they were exposed to an extensive training session, in which they were encouraged to ask questions and to discuss their task until they felt confident that they knew how to complete it successfully. As a result, they did not report any confusion about how to adopt a reappraisal strategy during negative and neutral trials. The self-reported data however still allow for alternative interpretations. Although participants are likely to have complied with the instruction to reappraise on neutral trials (i.e. they experienced stimuli as more neutral after reappraisal), the drop in discomfort ratings could reflect that participants were merely complying with the demands imposed by the experimental setup (i.e. reporting something that believed to comply with the instruction). In future studies, it might be informative to include ratings of subjective experience of effort, which presumably are less susceptible to experimental demands and that can be more directly related to activity in prefrontal areas such as the DLPFC that, at least partly, may reflect task demand.</p>
              <p>Taken together, this study is the first to directly contrast the relative contribution of two key regions during reappraisal; the DLPFC and the lateral OFC. We argue that (a) the DLPFC and the lateral OFC both contribute to negative emotion regulation, but (b) that these regions partly reflect different aspects of the emotion regulation process. Critically, our results showed that in contrast to the more general pattern of activation in the DLPFC, the lateral OFC was specifically and uniquely activated during reappraisal of negatively valenced stimuli. These findings add to a growing literature focused on disentangling the contributions of different prefrontal regions during emotion regulation.</p>
