                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious health risk behavior that forms the basis of a tentative diagnosis in DSM-5, NSSI Disorder (NSSID). To date, established treatments specific to NSSI or NSSID are scarce. As a first step in evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a novel treatment for adolescents with NSSID, we conducted an open trial of emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA): a 12-week, behavioral treatment aimed at directly targeting both NSSI and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion regulation difficulties.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Seventeen girls (aged 13–17; mean = 15.31) with NSSID were enrolled in a study adopting an uncontrolled open trial design with self-report and clinician-rated assessments of NSSI and other self-destructive behaviors, emotion regulation difficulties, borderline personality features, and global functioning administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Measures of NSSI and emotion regulation difficulties were also administered weekly during treatment.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Ratings of treatment credibility and expectancy and the treatment completion rate (88%) were satisfactory, and both therapeutic alliance and treatment attendance were strong. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant improvements associated with large effect sizes in past-month NSSI frequency, emotion regulation difficulties, self-destructive behaviors, and global functioning, as well as a medium effect size in past-month NSSI versatility, from pre- to post-treatment. Further, all of these improvements were either maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Finally, change in emotion regulation difficulties mediated improvements in NSSI over the course of treatment.</p>

NSSI has gained increased scientific attention over the past decade, and was included as a separate diagnostic entity within Section 3 “Conditions for further study” of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Criteria for the suggested NSSI disorder (NSSID) include engagement in NSSI on five or more days within the past year, and the expectation that the behavior will provide emotional or cognitive relief, resolve an interpersonal difficulty, and/or create a positive feeling state.</p>
              <p id="Par22">NSSID is associated with high psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), and is one of the strongest predictors of future suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The prevalence of NSSID in adolescent community samples ranges from 3.1 to 6.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Despite the clinical importance of NSSI and NSSID, established treatments specific to NSSI are scarce, and studies evaluating these treatments have produced mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a recent systematic review of treatments for NSSI in both adolescent and adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the authors concluded that the psychological treatments that show promise in reducing NSSI frequency are dialectical behavior therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]), manual-assisted cognitive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, another systematic review and meta-analysis on therapeutic interventions for self-injury among adolescents concluded that no psychological interventions are significantly superior to treatment as usual when NSSI is considered separately from suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for effective treatments for adolescents with NSSI.</p>
              <p id="Par24">ERGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] is an acceptance-based behavioral therapy developed to address the need for brief, clinically-feasible, efficacious interventions for NSSI in adults with borderline personality pathology. This 14-week treatment seeks to augment standard therapy provided in the community by directly targeting both NSSI and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion regulation difficulties. The most recently conducted randomized controlled trial of ERGT for adult women with borderline personality and recurrent NSSI revealed significant effects of this treatment on NSSI and other self-destructive behaviors (e.g., binge-eating and excessive drinking), emotion regulation difficulties, and symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), depression, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The utility of ERGT for NSSI has been supported in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, ERGT has not been evaluated for adolescents who engage in NSSI or have NSSID.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Given the efficacy of ERGT for NSSI in adults, as well as its brief and targeted format, we adapted ERGT to provide an ERGT-based individual therapy for adolescents (i.e., Emotion Regulation Individual Therapy for Adolescents; ERITA). Following recommendations for early studies in clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the present pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptance, and utility of this ERITA in an open uncontrolled pilot study. We expected that the credibility and acceptability of this treatment would be high. Consistent with past research on ERGT, we also expected to find significant improvements from pre- to post-treatment in NSSI, other self-destructive behaviors, emotion regulation difficulties, and BPD symptoms, as well as stability of these improvements during a 6-month follow up period. Finally, consistent with both past research on ERGT in adults (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) and the theory on which this treatment is based, we expected that change in emotion regulation difficulties would mediate improvements in NSSI during treatment.</p>

                <p id="Par26">The present study used an uncontrolled open trial design to examine the acceptability and utility of ERITA for NSSID among adolescent patients in four outpatient clinics in two of the major cities in Sweden, Stockholm and Malmö. All participants were referred from child and adolescent mental health services. Treatment included 12 weekly individual sessions adapted from the ERGT manual. In addition, parents were enrolled in a parent program delivered via the Internet. Baseline data were collected via interviews conducted by community-based health care professionals (with supervision by JB and HS) at the respective clinics and self-report measures. Self-report measures were also administered weekly during treatment. Post assessments were administered directly after the last session and at six months after completing treatment, and included both clinician administered interviews and self-report measures. All self-report measures used in the study were completed online (a method with demonstrated validity; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]) outside of the clinic.</p>

One exception to this is posttraumatic stress disorder, for which the diagnostic thresholds for children and adolescents were lowered in DSM-5; thus, it is possible that the assessment of DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder may have resulted in lower rates of this disorder relative to the use of DSM-5 criteria.</p>

                <p id="Par43">Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Primary analyses used a generalized estimation equation (GEE) with an exchangeable working correlation along with robust error estimation. The distribution of each outcome was examined prior to the analyses. The GEE models for the count variables (i.e., NSSI frequency and self-destructive behaviors) used a negative binomial distribution with a log link function, and the remaining continuous outcomes were analyzed using GEE models with a normal distribution with a log link function. Consistent with an intent-to-treat principle, all models included all available data for each outcome. We estimated separate coefficients for the change between the pre- and post-treatment assessments and the change between the post-treatment and six-month follow-up assessments. Regression weights that were inversely related to the probability of a value being observed as a function of time were included in the GEE models (an approach that gives unbiased estimation under the assumption of data missing at random; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]). Ordinal variables were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed ranks test.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Effect sizes were calculated for changes between pre-treatment and post-treatment, and post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. First, the average percentage change across time for the count variables (i.e., NSSI frequency and BSL) was calculated from the GEE models with 95% confidence intervals. This was performed by exponentiating the relevant beta, with the range below or above one interpreted as the percentage decrease or increase in the outcome for a one-unit increase in the predictor. Second, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was calculated for the remaining continuous outcomes by dividing the estimated means derived from the GEE models by the baseline standard deviation. For comparative reasons (with other studies), Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was also calculated for the count data, for which the GEE models used a normal distribution with log link function that were applied to log-transformed NSSI frequency and BSL scores, and corresponding effect sizes were extracted (these analyses were only used for effect size estimation, not to draw inferences about statistical significance or percentage change). The 95% confidence intervals for the effect sizes were calculated using 5000 bootstrap replications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] clustered on participants; i.e., if one participant was included in a bootstrap replication, all observations from this participant were included in the bootstrap replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Finally, we calculated the number of participants who reported no (zero) NSSI at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up and used McNemar’s mid-<italic>p</italic> test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] to analyze the changes between the assessment points (two observations were missing from the 6-month follow-up, and list-wise deletion was used in these specific analyses).</p>
                <p id="Par45">We also examined change in emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator of improvements in NSSI during treatment. Specifically, this analysis was performed in four steps that investigated the different paths of mediation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]: (1) the “<italic>c</italic>-path”, i.e., if week in treatment was associated with NSSI frequency; (2) the “<italic>a</italic>-path”, i.e., if week in treatment was associated with emotion regulation difficulties; (3) the “<italic>b</italic>-path”, i.e., if emotion regulation difficulties were associated with NSSI frequency (controlling for week in treatment); and <underline>(</underline>4) the <italic>ab</italic>-product, i.e., the indirect relation of time in treatment to improvement in NSSI through change in emotion regulation difficulties. We also calculated the proportion of the total relation of time in treatment to NSSI improvement that was accounted for by change in emotion regulation, P<sub>M</sub>, using the formula <italic>ab</italic> / <italic>c</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. These analyses were performed using linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes; NSSI frequency was log-transformed to fit the linear model.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Finally, we performed exploratory supplementary analyses to investigate the possible impact of concurrent medication use and treatment as usual on NSSI improvement during treatment. We did this by adding self-reported concurrent medication status (coded as 0 for no concurrent medication and 1 for concurrent medication) and self-reported frequency of contact with community clinicians (coded as a factor with the following levels: no contact during ERITA, monthly, once every second week, or weekly) as covariates in the model. These covariates were added both as simple effects and as interaction effects with the change in NSSI frequency from pre- to post-treatment.</p>

Likewise, results revealed a significant reduction in past-month NSSI versatility associated with a medium-sized effect from pre- to post-treatment, with additional significant improvements in NSSI versatility from post-treatment to 6-month follow-up. The most common past-month NSSI method at pre-treatment was cutting (<italic>n =</italic> 17; 100%), followed by severe scratching (<italic>n =</italic> 7; 41%), skin carving (<italic>n =</italic> 3; 18%), needle-sticking (<italic>n =</italic> 3; 18%), self-punching (<italic>n =</italic> 2; 11%), head-banging (<italic>n =</italic> 2; 11%), burning (<italic>n =</italic> 1; 6%), and self-biting (<italic>n</italic> = 1; 6%).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par56">The present study provides preliminary support for the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of ERITA in the treatment of NSSI and related difficulties among adolescents with NSSID. Results revealed significant improvements associated with medium to large effect sizes in past-month NSSI frequency, past-month NSSI versatility, emotion regulation difficulties, self-destructive behaviors, and global functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Further, all of these improvements were either maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, by the 6-month follow-up (although not before), symptoms of BPD had improved significantly from pre-treatment levels. Finally, the high ratings of treatment credibility and expectancy, combined with the good attendance and low attrition, highlight the acceptability and feasibility of this treatment among adolescents. Although preliminary, these findings are encouraging and comparable to those of past studies examining brief treatments for NSSI and/or self-injurious behaviors in adolescents and young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par57">Furthermore, and consistent with past research on ERGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], results of the present study provide support for emotion regulation as a mechanism of change in ERITA. Specifically, change in emotion regulation difficulties mediated the observed improvements in NSSI during treatment. These results provide support for the theoretical model underlying this treatment and add to the literature emphasizing the clinical utility of targeting emotion regulation in treatments for NSSI (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]).</p>
              <p id="Par58">Notably, inclusion criteria for this study were broad and exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum in order to enhance ecological validity. Although we did not explicitly recruit adolescents with BPD, nearly half of the sample (41%) met full DSM-IV criteria for BPD (consistent with past research suggesting high rates of BPD in clinical samples of adolescents with NSSI; e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Findings of small, non-significant improvements in BPD symptoms from pre- to post-treatment suggest that this treatment is not sufficient to have a meaningful impact on BPD symptoms beyond NSSI and other self-destructive behaviors in just 12 weeks. Rather, findings of a significant improvement in BPD symptoms from pre-treatment to the 6-month follow up suggest that a longer period of time may be necessary for the non-behavioral symptoms of BPD to change. It should be noted, however, that the risk for type II error due to low power was relatively high in this study. Therefore, replication of these findings in larger samples is needed before conclusions regarding the impact of this treatment on BPD symptoms can be drawn.</p>
              <p id="Par59">This study is the first to evaluate an adapted version of ERGT for adolescents. Following recommendations for early evaluations of treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the utility of this treatment was examined in an uncontrolled open pilot design. There are several limitations that warrant discussion, some of which are inherent to uncontrolled pilot studies. Most importantly, the absence of a randomized controlled design and/or control condition precludes any conclusions regarding the effects of ERITA (vs. the passage of time) on the outcomes of interest. Likewise, because all participants were required to have some form of psychiatric treatment in the community in addition to ERITA at baseline (and 29% reported concurrent psychotropic medication use), the potential impact of these treatments on the observed improvements cannot be determined. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the vast majority of the participants in this study (83%) reported minimal contact with their community provider over the course of ERITA, and our supplementary analyses of the impact of concurrent medication usage and community provider contact on reductions in NSSI frequency revealed no significant relations between these concurrent treatments and changes in NSSI over the course of treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that the observed improvements in NSSI in this study were the result of these community treatments alone. These results also highlight the potential utility of ERITA as a stand alone treatment for NSSI in adolescents. Further research examining the efficacy of this treatment in a randomized controlled trial is needed to further establish its utility for adolescents with NSSID.</p>
              <p id="Par60">An additional limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size, which reduces both our statistical power and the generalizability of our findings. Indeed, sufficient participant recruitment (in terms of both the breadth and size of the sample) is a critical component of any clinical trial and has important implications for interpreting study results. Yet, little is known about effective recruitment strategies for at-risk clinical populations, such as adolescents with NSSID, and there is almost no information available to researchers to aid in planning effective recruitment procedures in treatment outcome studies. For example, despite working closely with Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, we were only able to recruit 17 participants in an 8-month period. Future research is needed to explore possible barriers to more effective and efficient recruitment, including lack of knowledge of novel interventions, sufficient access to and satisfaction with available treatments in the community, lack of interest in or concern about clinical trials, or clinician reluctance to refer patients to a treatment study. Likewise, although repeated NSSI is also reported among boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], male gender has been shown to increase the likelihood of not receiving treatment after self-injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Consistent with this research, and despite no gender-based inclusion or exclusion criteria in this study, the final sample consisted of only girls. Thus, the extent to which the results generalize to boys is unclear and additional research examining the utility of this treatment in larger, mixed-gender samples is needed.</p>
