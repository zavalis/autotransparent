                <p>Facilitating engagement in rewarding activities is a key treatment target in depression. Mental imagery can increase engagement in planned behaviours, potentially due to its special role in representing emotionally salient experiences. The present study tested the hypothesis that mental imagery promotes motivation and engagement when planning pleasant and rewarding activities. Participants were recruited from a community volunteer panel (<italic>N</italic> = 72). They self-nominated six activities to complete over the following week, and were randomized to either: a) a single-session <italic>Motivational Imagery</italic> condition (<italic>N</italic> = 24); b) an <italic>Activity Reminder</italic> control condition (<italic>N</italic> = 24); or c) a <italic>No-Reminder</italic> control condition (<italic>N</italic> = 24). As predicted, relative to control groups, the Motivational Imagery group reported higher levels of <italic>motivation</italic>, <italic>anticipated pleasure,</italic> and <italic>anticipated reward</italic> for the planned activities. The <italic>Motivational Imagery</italic> group also completed significantly more activities than the <italic>Activity Reminder</italic> group, but not more than the <italic>No-Reminder</italic> group. Relevance of results to behavioural activation approaches for depression are discussed.</p>

            <p id="p0025">Motivating people to engage in specific behaviours (e.g. exercising, healthy eating) presents a significant challenge to different areas of science concerned with human behaviour, including public health, psychology and mental health science. For many activities it is not that they are difficult to do, but they are “put off”. Behaviour change interventions have often focussed on providing people with information about the risks and benefits of various alternatives. The hope that rational ‘cognitive’ analysis of such information will significantly influence subsequent choices is, sadly, all too often misplaced (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Marteau, Hollands, &amp; Fletcher, 2012</xref>). A complementary, more emotional than cognitive-rational, route to behaviour change might be to encourage individuals to “pre-experience” future planned behaviours and the accompanying emotional consequences via mental imagery (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Blackwell, Burnett Heyes, Renner, &amp; Raes, 2016</xref>). For example, it has been argued that imagery-based interventions might have greater impact on maladaptive motivation across a range of psychological disorders and maladaptive behaviours (e.g., <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kavanagh, Andrade, May, &amp; Connor, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">May, Andrade, &amp; Kavanagh, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Solbrig et al., 2018</xref>). Here we used an experimental psychopathology approach to test if motivation and engagement in both enjoyable (e.g. soaking in the bath) and routine (e.g. sorting household paperwork) activities could be facilitated by encouraging volunteers to engage in vivid mental imagery simulations of engaging in such activities.</p>
            <p id="p0030">If effective, this could be highly relevant to mental health conditions that exert a substantial burden on individuals, families and wider society. In depression, for example, individuals may experience difficulty in imagining positive aspects of future experiences and, as a consequence, be less likely to plan and engage in these activities (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Renner &amp; Holmes, 2018</xref>). They can therefore deprive themselves of the potentially positive aspects (e.g. social contact) that could have improved mood symptoms. Low mood is therefore perpetuated, and negative world views remain unchallenged, due to a lack of rewarding interactions with one's environment (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lewinsohn, 1974</xref>). It is increasingly acknowledged that features such as avoidance are not unique to particular psychological disorders but part of many and, accordingly, interventions that target such features may have ‘transdiagnostic’ applications. Alterations in motivational processes such as reward anticipation are among the most common symptoms in poor mental health (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zald &amp; Treadway, 2017</xref>) and therefore provide a candidate mechanism to target transdiagnostically. Thus, here we propose that one way to more directly target motivational processes of behavioural activities might be by simulating engagement in these planned activities via mental imagery (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Renner &amp; Holmes, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Renner, Ji, Pictet, Holmes, &amp; Blackwell, 2017</xref>).</p>
            <p id="p0035">Mental imagery refers to perceptual experiences in the absence of sensory input, regarded as a “weak” form of perception (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pearson, Naselaris, Holmes, &amp; Kosslyn, 2015</xref>). Neuroscientific evidence suggests that the brain structures that underlie mental imagery resemble those that underlie actual perception (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kosslyn, Ganis, &amp; Thompson, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>), giving rise to an ‘as-real’ experience of mental imagery simulations (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ji, Burnett Heyes, MacLeod, &amp; Holmes, 2016</xref>). Recruiting mental imagery has a more powerful impact on emotions (positive and negative) than does verbal processing of the same information (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Lang, &amp; Shah, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Holmes &amp; Mathews, 2005</xref>) and is experienced as more “real” than verbal processing (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mathews, Ridgeway, &amp; Holmes, 2013</xref>). Vividness of mental imagery is an important aspect for the beneficial effects of imagery interventions (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Renner et al., 2017</xref>). Mental imagery allows us to “pre-experience” future activities and thereby to anticipate their potential to be pleasant and rewarding (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2016</xref>). Anticipating the emotional consequences of our future behaviour, whether positive or negative, is essential to decision making (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2012</xref>) and guides behaviour (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg &amp; Conner, 2008</xref>). Motivation refers to an internal state that prompts and sustains goal directed behaviour. Based on previous findings, we propose that mental imagery may act as a ‘<italic>motivational amplifier</italic>’, promoting actual engagement in activities (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Renner &amp; Holmes, 2018</xref>) by a) increasing motivational aspects of planned activities such as anticipated reward (near transfer), which serves to b) increase behavioural engagement in planned activities (far transfer).</p>

              <title>The present study</title>
              <p id="p0040">To test the “motivational amplifier” hypotheses, the present study tested the impact of guided motivational imagery of planned pleasant and routine activities on ratings of motivation, anticipated pleasure, anticipated reward and behavioural engagement. The motivational imagery group was compared against an activity reminder control condition as well as a no-imagery no-reminder control condition. Completion of target activities were measured over the subsequent week via an activity diary.</p>
              <p id="p0045">We hypothesized that 1) compared to the control conditions, individuals in the motivational imagery condition would show greater increases in self-ratings (motivation, anticipated pleasure and anticipated reward) of their activities from pre-to post-experimental manipulation (i.e. near transfer); 2) within the motivational imagery condition, vividness ratings of the imagined target activities would correlate positively with activity self-ratings post activity scheduling (motivation, anticipated pleasure and anticipated reward); 3) compared to both control conditions (activity reminder and no-imagery no-reminder), participants in the motivational imagery condition would engage in a higher number of scheduled target activities outside of the laboratory during participants’ everyday lives (i.e. far transfer). In addition to these a priori hypotheses, we explored a) baseline predictors of experimental effects, b) change in questionnaires measures of overall behavioural activation, depression, anxiety and stress; and c) group differences in experienced pleasure, reward, effort, and mood.</p>

The laboratory session employed a mixed design with ratings completed at two points (pre activity scheduling, post activity scheduling). Activity scheduling here refers to the planning of activities. In the laboratory session, participants were randomly assigned to activity scheduling with or without motivational imagery (motivational imagery condition vs. combined control condition). For the activity week outside the laboratory, control condition participants were further assigned to either the activity reminder control condition or the no-imagery no-reminder control condition (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the research design, experimental conditions and outcome measures.

They were instructed to select only activities they did not already routinely engage in, that did not require extensive preparation, and that could be done for 10 min or longer. Examples of selected activities include “reading before bed” “doing yoga exercises” “working on a crossword” or “clearing out old items”. Where the activity chosen by a participant was broad (e.g. “research how to do something”), s/he was asked to choose a more specific activity (e.g. “research different energy supplier options”).</p>

Participants in the activity reminder control group and participants in the no-imagery no-reminder control group repeated these ratings directly after activity scheduling (with no imagery instructions of the respective activity). Prior to activity scheduling, participants also rated how important each selected activity was to them, how much they had been putting each activity off, and how difficult they typically found it to make time for the activity.

Participants were instructed to concentrate and close their eyes during the imagery task and to focus on the most positive aspects of their image while imagining themselves doing the activity. The experimenter guided participants through an imagery script focussing on 1) contextual cues of the activity (e.g. date/time, context and place) as specified by participants at the time of scheduling the activities; 2) multi-sensory (e.g. visual, auditory, sensory) engagement in the activity; 3) positive aspects associated with the activity; and 4) vivid imagery of the most powerful and motivating part of their image. The script was written by the research team following initial pilot testing. During the experimental session the experimenter read the script to the participant inserting the relevant information for the respective activity (context, time, date etc.) while reading the script out loud.

To control for the presentation of reminders per se, participants in the activity-reminder control condition also received text messages reminding them of the planned activities, but without imagery instructions. Participants in both the motivational imagery condition and activity reminder condition received two text messages per day during the activity week outside the laboratory. The text messages did not specify any detail about the nature or timing of the upcoming activity. In the motivational imagery condition the text message encouraged use of vivid mental imagery of the most powerful and motivating part of their image for the upcoming activity. In the activity reminder condition the text message included the words “activity reminder” to remind participants of the upcoming activity.</p>

Next, participants identified their “enjoyable” and <italic>“</italic>routine<italic>”</italic> target activities (akin to standard procedures for Behavioural Activation treatment), and provided activity ratings for each activity and scheduled them for the next week. The activity scheduling was done with or without mental imagery (motivational imagery condition vs. control conditions). Participants were then given an activity diary with instructions on how to record the following after each completed activity each day: (1) whether or not they had completed their planned activity, including when and for how long, (2) mood ratings immediately following each activity, and (3) where they had not managed to complete an activity, to provide a reason why. Participants in the motivational imagery condition and in the activity reminder condition were then informed that they would receive two text messages at random points in time before each planned activity (see above). At the end of the session, participants received payment for their time and a pre-paid return envelope to post the activity diary back.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Baseline questionnaires and baseline activity ratings per condition.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0035">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Baseline Questionnaires</th><th colspan="4">Condition<xref rid="tbl2fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref><hr/></th></tr><tr><th>Motivational Imagery (n = 24)</th><th>Activity Reminder (n = 24)</th><th>No-Imagery No-Reminder (n = 24)</th><th>ANOVA/χ<sup>2</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Imagery</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> SUIS, M (SD)</td><td align="left">36.83 (7.40)</td><td align="left">35.88 (7.84)</td><td align="left">40.45 (6.80)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 2.59, <italic>p</italic> = .08</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> PSI-Q</td><td align="left">6.96 (1.30)</td><td align="left">6.95 (1.38)</td><td align="left">6.79 (1.55)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = .89</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Mood</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Stress (DASS-21)</td><td align="left">4.58 (3.15)</td><td align="left">4.54 (4.35)</td><td align="left">4.20 (2.62)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = .92</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Anxiety (DASS-21)</td><td align="left">1.5 (2.46)</td><td align="left">2.38 (3.29)</td><td align="left">1.88 (2.44)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> = .54</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Depression (DASS-21)</td><td align="left">2.04 (2.46)</td><td align="left">3.75 (5.35)</td><td align="left">2.00 (2.21)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 1.18, <italic>p</italic> = .17</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Positive Affect</td><td align="left">29.42 (5.71)</td><td align="left">30.71 (7.88)</td><td align="left">31.08 (6.87)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = .68</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Negative Affect</td><td align="left">11.79 (2.19)</td><td align="left">12.46 (4.19)</td><td align="left">12.25 (3.01)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.27, <italic>p</italic> = .77</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Behavioural Activation</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> BADS Total</td><td align="left">112.79 (23.34)</td><td align="left">103.17 (26.35)</td><td align="left">107.08 (21.54)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.99, <italic>p</italic> = .38</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Pleasure/Anhedonia</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> TEPS Anticipatory</td><td align="left">36.83 (5.14)</td><td align="left">36.25 (5.24)</td><td align="left">36.92 (5.59)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = .90</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> TEPS Consummatory</td><td align="left">42.38 (5.69)</td><td align="left">41.63 (5.50)</td><td align="left">44.42 (5.60)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 1.60, <italic>p</italic> = .21</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> DARS</td><td align="left">81.21 (11.73)</td><td align="left">82.38 (10.25)</td><td align="left">84.29 (12.30)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> = .64</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left"><bold>Baseline activity ratings</bold><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Putting off activity</td><td align="left">69.79 (14.12)</td><td align="left">68.92 (11.81)</td><td align="left">69.97 (21.61)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = .97</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Importance of activity</td><td align="left">66.05 (12.47)</td><td align="left">74.02 (12.51)</td><td align="left">69.32 (14.34)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 2.23, <italic>p</italic> = .12</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Difficulty to make time for activity</td><td align="left">59.83 (22.75)</td><td align="left">60.17 (21.75)</td><td align="left">63.85 (21.20)</td><td align="left"><italic>F</italic>(2,69) = 0.25, <italic>p</italic> = .78</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><bold>Note.</bold> SUIS = Spontaneous Use of Imagery Scale, PSI-Q = Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire, DASS-21 = Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, BADS = Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale, TEPS = Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale, DARS = Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl2fna"><label>a</label><p id="ntpara0025">Statistics reported in this Table tested differences between three conditions (motivational imagery, activity reminder, no-imagery no-reminder).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0205">This study examined whether guided motivational imagery enhanced motivation for, and behavioural engagement in planned enjoyable and routine activities. Results suggest mental imagery can act as a <italic>motivational amplifier</italic> for both planned enjoyable and routine activities. Compared with two conditions in which imagery was not explicitly encouraged, participants who had engaged in mental imagery simulation showed a stronger increase on all scales assessing motivational aspects of the scheduled activities (motivation, anticipated pleasure, and anticipated reward) from pre to post activity scheduling. In addition, despite receiving equal number of text reminders, participants encouraged to use imagery completed significantly more activities than those who were not given explicit imagery guidance.</p>
              <p id="p0210">A caveat here is that the completion rates were not significantly greater in the motivational imagery group than those of the no-imagery no-reminder control group who received neither explicit imagery guidance nor reminders. In a between-participant design there are many factors relating to individual propensity for task completion and variation in task selection. For example, while not statistically significant, participants in the no-imagery no-reminder condition had relatively high scores on the Spontaneous Use of Imagery Scale (SUIS) compared to the other two groups. While speculative, it is possible that participants in this group tended to use imagery spontaneously during the activity week. An alternative explanation is that the significant effect of group on the number of completed activities is actually driven by a low number of completed activities in the activity reminder condition. Participants in this condition might have experienced the activity reminders as irritating resulting in a lower completion rate. In line with this explanation, when asked if they found the reminder prompts useful in reminding them of the planned activities, participants in the activity reminder condition indicated they only found the prompts useful for approximately two out of six activities. Further work using a greater range of activities over a longer period and potentially more sensitive measures such as ‘experience sampling’ will help to establish the likely reliability of the enhanced completion finding. Overall, however, these findings are in line with the overarching hypothesis that using mental imagery can promote engagement in behavioural activities.</p>
              <p id="p0215">Why might mental imagery of future behavioural activities promote motivation and actual engagement? Mental imagery is a core component of the ‘prospective brain’, a functional network allowing us to predict and plan for the future (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Moulton &amp; Kosslyn, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Schacter, Addis, &amp; Buckner, 2008</xref>). Mental images can evoke strong emotional and neurophysiological reactions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2016</xref>) and imagery simulations of future events impact subjective probability ratings of these events to happen (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Raune, MacLeod, &amp; Holmes, 2005</xref>). These features of mental imagery may impact motivational aspects of future behaviours such as anticipated reward and anticipated pleasure when simulating engagement in positive future events. Anticipated emotions in turn drive decision making and goal directed behaviours (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gorka et al., 2014</xref>). For example, albeit in the opposite direction, greater levels of anticipated regret of engaging in a health risk behaviour predict weaker behavioural engagement in these behaviours (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brewer, DeFrank, &amp; Gilkey, 2016</xref>). Similarly, increasing positive anticipated emotions via mental imagery may have a knock-on effect on motivation and behaviour, i.e. act as a <italic>motivational amplifier</italic>. As one participant in the motivational imagery condition noted in a feedback email: “<italic>I thought doing visualisations was a great way to get myself to do the activities I miss out on, and it does seem to work. It made me happy and look forward to doing the activities</italic>”.</p>
              <p id="p0220">Mental imagery of future behavioural activities in this study increased anticipated pleasure and anticipated reward, relative to control groups. Thus individuals in the motivational imagery condition predicted that engaging in the planned activities would be more pleasant and more rewarding compared to those in control groups. However, ratings of actual pleasantness and reward upon activity completion did not differ between the groups, suggesting that there was a discrepancy between what participants predicted and how the planned activities actually turned out to be once completed. This finding is interesting in the context of the affective forecasting literature. When people make predictions of how they will feel about events in the future (i.e. affective forecasts) they typically overestimate the emotional impact of these events (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2005</xref>). Importantly, predictions of how we will feel about events in the future drive our decision making and actions (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mellers &amp; McGraw, 2001</xref>). In the context of depression it has been shown that affective forecasting in individuals with depression is biased towards more extreme negative affective forecasts and less extreme positive forecasts compared to healthy controls (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wenze, Gunthert, &amp; German, 2012</xref>). Our findings suggest that the imagery manipulation increased the affective forecasting bias for positive future events. Future research should test if similar imagery interventions can help reduce the negative forecasting bias in depression.</p>
              <p id="p0225">We also found that the more vividly participants imagined the scheduled activities the higher their anticipated reward ratings of engaging with them. Future research should further explore boosting positive imagery vividness in promoting motivation for behavioural activities, specifically in individuals who struggle to form vivid positive images such as those with depression (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0230">We also explored baseline predictors of motivational imagery effects and found that the propensity of participants to “put-off” activities in the past predicted activity completion rates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests that the most difficult behavioural targets, things that people have been <italic>least</italic> inclined to do, may benefit most from this imagery intervention. This makes more intuitive sense when expressed in terms of the corollary; participants are more likely to engage in behaviours that they have not tended to “put off” thus reducing any <italic>additional</italic> benefit of imagery. It is nevertheless encouraging in terms of procrastination, delaying unpleasant activities despite negative consequences of such delay (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Klingsieck, 2013</xref>). In a health context, procrastination has been linked to poor physical health (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sirois, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sirois, Melia-Gordon, &amp; Pychyl, 2003</xref>) and mental health (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Stead, Shanahan, &amp; Neufeld, 2010</xref>) outcomes, including anxiety and depression. If, as our data suggest, motivational imagery interventions may be particularly effective for these types of activities the clinical implication of these results may be considerable. The results are also consistent with our previous studies showing beneficial effects of positive mental imagery on behavioural activation in individuals with depression (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Renner et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0235">Our findings, if replicated, have potential implications for research on novel intervention development in clinical psychology and public health. Imagery procedures could potentially be used to increase motivation and engagement in health related behaviours such as physical activities (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chan &amp; Cameron, 2012</xref>) or healthy eating (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Knäuper et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, psychological interventions aiming to increase behavioural activation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martell, Addis, &amp; Jacobson, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Martell et al., 2010</xref>) could potentially benefit from the motivation enhancing effects of mental imagery simulations of enjoyable and routine activities (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Renner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Renner &amp; Holmes, 2018</xref>). This is consistent with a mechanistic approach to intervention innovation by focussing on core brain-behaviour dimensions (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Insel et al., 2010</xref>) (e.g. reward anticipation) to identify psychological mechanisms that are common to multiple mental disorders and to develop new, more direct, ways to target these (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Craske, &amp; Graybiel, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>). However, note that the motivation enhancing effects of imagery might not transfer to a behavioural level as our data suggests that the completion rates were not significantly greater in the motivational imagery group than those of the no-imagery no-reminder control group. The findings of this study provide initial evidence suggesting that mental imagery of planned activities increases motivation to engage in these activities. This core finding now needs replication in independent samples following the same experimental procedures after appropriate training in the use of the mental imagery as motivational amplifier protocol. There are clearly several areas of the wider psychology literature that are relevant to this topic, which should also be further explored in future developments of this work including work on implementation intentions, mental contrasting, and goal and activity planning (e.g. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Coote &amp; MacLeod, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Farquharson &amp; MacLeod, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gollwitzer, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Oettingen &amp; Mayer, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0240">Several limitations should be taken into account when considering the results of this study. We recruited a non-clinical sample from the general population and included a broad range of potentially enjoyable and rewarding activities. It remains unclear if our results would generalize to specific behavioural activities in target groups such as physical activities for sedentary individuals. Future studies might focus on specific target groups and specific types of behaviours. We used self-report scales to assess activity ratings in the lab. Future studies should seek to include additional measures of motivation that include objective measures to supplement behavioural findings.</p>
              <p id="p0245">In summary, the current study provides proof of concept evidence that mental imagery, by allowing individuals to pre-experience rewarding and positive aspects of potential future activities, might act as a <italic>motivational amplifier</italic>: Simulating engagement in future behavioural activities via mental imagery increases motivation to engage in these activities which can transfer to actual behaviour. These findings can help inform future studies that aim to develop and apply mental imagery interventions in the areas of public health and clinical psychology where the aim is to motivate people for behaviour change, and ultimately, improve people's quality of life, and wellbeing.</p>
