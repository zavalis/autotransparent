                  <p id="P1">The number of refugees is the highest ever worldwide. Many have
experienced trauma in home countries or on their escape which has mental
health sequelae. Intrusive memories comprise distressing scenes of trauma

                  <p id="P2">We propose that brief cognitive science-driven interventions should
be developed which pinpoint a focal symptom alongside a means to monitor it
using behavioural techniques. The aim of the current study was to assess the
feasibility and acceptability of the methodology required to develop such an

                  <p id="P3">In this study we recruited 22 refugees (16–25 years),
predominantly from Syria and residing in Sweden. Participants were asked to
monitor the frequency of intrusive memories of trauma using a daily diary;
rate intrusions and concentration; and complete a 1-session behavioural
intervention involving Tetris game-play via smartphone.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">The global refugee crisis is escalating, as exemplified by events in Syria
(<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
[UNHCR], 2015</xref>). Even once in a safe country, refugees are often plagued
by vivid mental images of traumatic events – called ‘<italic>intrusive
memories’</italic> – that repeatedly spring to mind unbidden
(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>).
Exposure to traumatic events, within Syria or on the escape to Europe, have profound
mental health consequences (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al.,
2015</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abbott, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Nature Editorial, 2016</xref>) that interfere with
acquiring skills needed to integrate into the new environment (e.g. language
learning), for example by disrupting concentration. The UNHCR report on the mental
health of Syrians (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>)
highlights culture-specific idioms of distress such as ‘<italic>mou adder
rakkezz’</italic> – ‘I can’t focus, I can’t
concentrate’. Intrusive sensory memories occur across several psychiatric
disorders (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bryant et al., 2011</xref>), notably in
those disorders with high prevalence in refugees (e.g. <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bogic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hollander et
al., 2016</xref>). These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Grey and Holmes, 2008</xref>), depression (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Birrer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Moulds, 2008</xref>) prolonged grief (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bryant et al., 2014</xref>), and psychosis (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Morrison, 2004</xref>). Intrusive sensory memories
present a possible ‘transdiagnostic’ target for intervention (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Fairburn et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P7">Of the more than a million refugees that reached the European Union in 2015
(<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">UNHCR, 2015</xref>), Sweden has taken the
highest numbers per capita with 162,877 asylum applications in 2015 alone (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">The Swedish Migration Agency [Migrationsverket],
2015</xref>). Almost two-thirds of these applications were from individuals aged
13–24 years, and many from unaccompanied minors, constituting 50.3% of all
children between 0 and 17 years who applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015 (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">The Swedish Migration Agency [Migrationsverket],
2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P8">Trauma-associated mental health problems incur heavy costs to individuals and
society: there is urgent need for language-free, simple-to-deliver treatments that
can reach a large and dispersed refugee population (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann et al., 2015</xref>). However, innovation is sorely needed as most
psychological treatments cannot reach people with mental illnesses at international
scale (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin and Blase, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin and Rabbitt, 2013</xref>). Refugee host
countries lack capacity to deploy evidence-based psychological treatments at the
scale needed as they typically require face-to-face contact with a therapist/lay
worker (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2011</xref>) alongside
interpreters (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann et al., 2015</xref>).
Furthermore, the number of psychological treatments tested with refugee populations
is low (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Nickerson et al., 2011</xref>), raising
questions of cultural acceptability (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al.,
2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P9">Approaches could be: (i) to utilize smartphone technology – which is
appealing and accessible to young people from Syria (87%; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Mohr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Central
Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2016</xref>) – in a given language, e.g.
Arabic; (ii) to take a mechanistically focused cognitive approach from experimental
psychopathology and target one tractable symptom (rather than a whole syndrome); and
(iii) to focus not only on reducing psychological distress but also downstream
improvements in <italic>functioning</italic> (e.g. adaption to a host country),
particularly given refugees’ motivation for improvement, demonstrated by
travelling miles through danger and obstacles to reach a better life.</p>
              <p id="P10">We propose that certain behavioural interventions could be delivered at
minimal cost, directly (without a therapist/interpreter), by smartphone, in
refugees’ daily life. Our vision is galvanized by the recent concept of
‘massive open online interventions’ (MOOIs) (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>). ‘<italic>MOOIs have the
potential to increase the reach, scalability, and affordability of psychological
interventions … This term was inspired by the growing popularity of
massive open online courses</italic> (<italic>MOOCs</italic>) <italic>…
which attract millions of students …. Digital interventions … can
be used again and again by people anywhere in the world</italic>’ (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P11">We have experimentally derived simple-to-deliver methods to reduce the
frequency of intrusive memories of trauma via computer game-play. A one-session
behavioural intervention (involving the game Tetris) at specified time points,
reduces the frequency of intrusive memories of experimental trauma (film footage) by
approximately half (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2009</xref>;
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests a technique
that could be developed after real trauma. Mental disorders and attending mental
health services is associated with stigma in Syrian cultures (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2015</xref>). Young people particularly can be
reluctant to access psychiatric/psychological services, thus computer-gaming in
daily life opens new possibilities to provide support in non-/less-stigmatizing
ways.</p>
              <p id="P12">This feasibility study with young refugees recently residing in Sweden is a
first step towards future scalable intervention development. We explored monitoring
one target symptom, simple measures of functioning, and the acceptability of a novel
intervention procedure. Participants were asked to (a) monitor the frequency count
of intrusive memories of trauma for one week using a daily intrusion diary; (b) rate
concentration disruption and intrusive memory occurrence over a week; and (c)
complete a one-session intervention involving Tetris gameplay via smartphone. An
important aspect of the research was whether these procedures were feasible without
an interpreter, given that reliance on interpreters would massively increase
treatment costs and impede scalability.</p>

                <title>Participants and recruitment procedure</title>
                <p id="P13">Twenty-two young refugees (mean age 22 years, SD = 2.4; 17 males, 5
females) participated. Sixteen (73%) were from Syria, three from Iraq, and three
not specified. Twenty participants (91%) had Arabic as their first language; the
remaining two (9%) spoke Arabic, but had a different mother tongue. Eighteen
participants (82%) had arrived in Sweden in the last 6 months before study
participation; three individuals arrived 7–12 months earlier, and one
individual arrived more than 12 months earlier. Ten participants (46%) had had
more than 12 years of education, seven participants (32%) had between 10 and 12
years, four participants (18%) had between 6 and 9 years, and one participant
had less than 5 years of education.</p>
                <p id="P14">Participants were recruited via posters in Swedish, English and Arabic,
advertised digitally through social media (e.g. Facebook pages of Refugees
Welcome and Save the Children) and advertised in paper in relevant institutions
(non-governmental organizations [NGOs], religious institutions, cultural
initiatives, government agencies, and refugee accommodation), and by handing
information sheets to passing individuals at refugee accommodation (with help
from local staff members). Sixteen people were recruited via refugee
accommodation (73%), two via Swedish language classes (9%), two via direct
approach at the central station in Stockholm (9%), one (5%) via Facebook, and
one (5%) via a NGO. Recruitment and interviewing was done in Swedish/English
(orally and on paper) and in Arabic (on paper), without the presence of an
interpreter. Afterwards, the participant’s written responses were
translated from Arabic/Swedish into English.</p>

written, informed consent before participation; in case of minors consent was
given in agreement with their custodian. The authors assert that all procedures
contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of Regional Ethical
Review Board Stockholm on human experimentation and with the Helsinki

(morning/afternoon/evening) when the intrusive memory occurred, or marked
‘zero’ if they experienced none. Intrusive memories were
described as: ‘images of traumatic events that pop into your mind
without warning. They often take the form of visual pictures in your
mind’s eye, e.g. like a snapshot image or a film clip. They can also
include other senses such as sounds and smells, such as the smell of smoke.
They may or may not be triggered by something you are aware of, such as
telling someone about what happened, or watching something on the
news.’ Participants were not to record memories recalled deliberately
or general verbal thoughts. Instructions were based on previous protocols
(see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental
Material</xref>) and a short definition of flashback/intrusive memories
was printed on the intrusion diary as a reminder. Check marks were summed to

                  <p id="P22">The cognitive task intervention procedure involved two key

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Horsch and Holmes, 2016</xref>). The
following instructions were used to reactivate trauma memory: ‘We
asked you in the information sheet about any traumatic events that you may
have experienced. You don’t need to tell about this, but to make the
computer game as helpful as possible, we just need to make sure that the
traumatic event is in your mind just before you do the task. So I’d
like you to think back to the traumatic event for a brief moment,
specifically the worst moments that pop back to mind (intrusive memories
that flash to mind). You don’t need to think about it in detail. Let
me help you – did anything pop into your mind? Are there any images
that are flashing to mind or any bits of the traumatic event you can see
again? It’s OK, you don’t have to tell me what happened, as
long as the images were in your mind that’s fine.’ Following
instructions and a practice, participants were asked to play Tetris for at
least one uninterrupted period of 15 min (or longer if they wished) on their
smartphone.</p>

frequency of the intrusive memories?’ from 0 (not at all acceptable)
to 10 (very acceptable). An example of an open-ended question related to
preference for mode of delivery of the intervention was ‘How would

followed by the computer game-play cognitive task procedure. This involved
reactivating a memory of trauma and 15–20 min of Tetris game-play on
their smartphones. Instructions for the daily intrusion diary were given. Next,
feasibility and acceptability feedback questions were collected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Material</xref>),
with answers written by the participant in their preferred language. The session
lasted between 60 and 90 min.</p>

intrusion diary to measure the frequency of their intrusive memories of trauma
(7–10 on a scale from 0 to 10). Seventeen participants (77%) then
returned the pen-and-paper intrusion diary by post after 1 week. Of the five
that did not return the diary, one felt too sad to complete the study due to
receiving bad news from Syria about family (as we were informed by his
custodian), and one appeared to not have understood the information properly.
The other three dropped out without providing a reason and did not reply to
mobile phone SMS (short messaging service).</p>
                <p id="P29">Critically, diary data indicated a mean of almost two intrusive memories
per day (mean = 1.81, SD = 1.39). The mean number of intrusive memories weekly
was 12.65 (SD = 9.71). Of the 17 participants who returned the intrusion diary,
13 (59%) rated 5 or higher on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (all of them) when
asked how many of their intrusive memories they had recorded in their diary
(mean = 6.53; median = 6.00; mode = 6; SD = 2.62; range 2–10).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P37">In this study we explored intrusive memories of trauma and concentration in
young refugees predominantly from Syria who recently arrived in Sweden.
Specifically, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of methodology required
to develop science-driven interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of intrusive
memories of trauma. Levels of engagement with study procedures were highly
promising. Results suggest a high prevalence of intrusive memories and concentration
difficulties in this population and suggest a relationship between these symptoms:
more than half of participants indicated that each intrusive memory disrupted their
concentration for more than 5 min. Furthermore, participants reporting a higher
frequency of intrusive memories also reported more concentration problems in
general. Free report data suggested related functional impairment on tasks
associated with adaptation to the host country such as language learning.</p>
              <p id="P38">Supporting the development of novel and scalable psychological intervention
procedures (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin and Blase, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin and Rabbitt, 2013</xref>), our data indicate
that young refugees are able and willing to (a) monitor a target symptom –
the frequency count of intrusive memories of trauma for 1 week using a daily
intrusion diary; (b) rate intrusive memories and concentration levels; and (c)
complete one session of computer game-play (Tetris) on their smartphone as part of a
mechanistically driven intervention procedure. These procedures were feasible
without an interpreter, highlighting the potential large-scale application of such
interventions in line with the concept of a future MOOI (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P39">We have argued that psychological treatments can benefit from advances in
neuroscience (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2014</xref>). Candidate
mechanisms to alter trauma memory are offered by understanding the neuroscience of
memory reconsolidation (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Nader and Einarsson,
2010</xref>), alongside insights from cognitive psychology (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 1997</xref>) which capitalize on
special features of intrusive memories – disrupting their mental
imagery-based nature (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Grey and Holmes, 2008</xref>;
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Engelhard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>). Earlier experimental
work shows that the effect of the cognitive-task intervention procedure in reducing
intrusive memory frequency is specific to visuospatial tasks (e.g. Tetris) when
compared with a verbal control game (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al.,
2010</xref>). Further, this method is effective not only for recently viewed
trauma footage, but also for established memories (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>). A recent randomized control trial (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai and Holmes, 2015</xref>) has successfully
extended findings to a hospital emergency department setting with patients after a
traumatic road traffic accident. A main advantage of this technological
intervention, as underscored by results from the current study, is the potential for
therapist-free delivery, enabling large-scale dissemination (for example via a MOOI;
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>) and cultural
acceptability to young refugees.</p>
              <p id="P40">Limitations of this feasibility study include the small sample size and the
sampling procedure, which may have resulted in a less representative sample, and
possibly an underestimation of the scale of the problem (individuals with more
severe psychological problems may be reluctant to volunteer for research studies).
Further limitations include the lack of a control group and a full clinical
interview to assess post-traumatic symptoms. Instead, we took a pragmatic approach,
given the urgency of the topic. Whilst the study is modest, alongside the paucity of
research in this area and the current ‘epidemic’ scale of traumatized
refugees, results offer a small step towards scalable innovation: new ways to (a)
develop and deliver psychological treatments for refugees by focusing on one target
symptom (not a syndrome); (b) deliver research materials in another language; and
(c) bridge a novel behavioural treatment approach for mental health with human
memory theory.</p>
              <p id="P41">Compliance with the 1-week intrusion measurement was high (78% of
participants returned the diary by post). The 22% drop-out is remarkably low given
that most participants were not familiar with the concept of paper postal services.
Following the impact of war there has been no postal service in Syria for some
years, with smartphone technology almost entirely replacing its use. We included a
photograph of a post-box in the study material to explain the concept of paper diary
return. Future studies harnessing technology for symptom monitoring would probably
improve compliance (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 2014</xref>). This
is corroborated by the finding that attitudes towards using smartphone technology
for symptom monitoring and intervention delivery were generally positive.</p>
              <p id="P42">Participants reported, on average, two intrusions a day, which is higher
than the maximum score (‘daily’) on the Clinician-Administered PTSD
Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Elhai et al.,
2005</xref>). A goal to reduce one intrusion per day could represent a change from
CAPS-5 maximum (‘daily’) to mid-minimum (‘once-or-twice a
week’/‘never’), representing a clinically meaningful outcome
target for future research.</p>
              <p id="P43">Participants indicated that their intrusive memories typically disrupted
their concentration for several minutes (mode 5–10), suggesting that
intrusive memories were not only distressing, but also impaired functioning by
disrupting focus on daily tasks (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Material</xref>). Given that persistent intrusive
memories are common after trauma, even in the absence of full clinical criteria for
PTSD, intrusive memory and their associated ‘hotspots’ in the
underlying trauma memory constitute an important target for treatment (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Grey et al., 2002</xref>). Reducing intrusions holds
promise to <italic>prevent</italic> the deterioration of mental health, and further
to promote improvements in daily functioning, such as language-learning, key to
integration for refugees entering a new country (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abbott, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Nature Editorial,
2016</xref>), and associated with later employment (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Daniel and Zurawan, 2010</xref>). Behavioural interventions focusing on
a tractable target symptom (here intrusions) may have knock-on effects on other risk
factors, promoting resilience and adaptive functioning. Scalable psychological
treatments have long been needed (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin and Blase,
2011</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin and Rabbitt, 2013</xref>)
and the current refugee crisis makes their development an imperative direction for
clinical psychological science.</p>

                <p>Example of paper-and-pencil intrusion diary in Arabic, used to assess the
frequency count of intrusive memories of trauma daily for 1-week. Participants
indicate with ticks per day how many intrusive memories they had in the morning,
afternoon and evening, and to write down a zero if they did not experience any
intrusive memories (A). Bar graph depicting number of intrusive memories of
trauma in the intrusion diary per day for one week (returned by 17
participants), indicating a mean of almost two intrusive memories a day (M =
1.81, SD = 1.39). The mean count over the week was 12.65 (SD = 9.71). Error bars
depict standard error of the mean (B). Pie chart displaying the estimated amount
of time that a single intrusive memory disrupts concentration. Part size
represents number of participants reporting a given duration (C). Scatterplot
showing a relation between the occurrence of intrusive memories in the preceding
week measured on as scale from 0 (none) to 10 (numerous/ all the time), and
general concentration difficulties measured on a scale from 0 (no difficulties)
to 10 (extreme difficulties) (D)</p>
