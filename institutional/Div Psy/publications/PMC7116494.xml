              <abstract>
                <p id="P1">Methods to reduce intrusive memories (e.g., of traumatic events) should
ideally spare voluntary memory for the same event (e.g., to report on the event
in court). Single-trace memory accounts assume that interfering with a trace
should impact both its involuntary and voluntary expressions, whereas
separate-trace accounts assume these two can dissociate, allowing for
<italic>selective</italic> interference. This possibility was investigated
in 3 experiments. Nonclinical participants viewed a trauma film followed by an
interference task (Tetris game-play after reminder cues). Next, memory for the
film was assessed with various measures. The interference task reduced the
number of intrusive memories (diary-based, Experiments 1 and 2), but spared
performance on well-matched measures of voluntary retrieval—free recall
(Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiments 1 and 2)—challenging
single-trace accounts. The interference task did not affect other measures of
involuntary retrieval—perceptual priming (Experiment 1) or attentional
bias (Experiment 2). However, the interference task did reduce the number of
intrusive memories in a laboratory-based vigilance-intrusion task (Experiments 2
and 3), irrespective of concurrent working memory load during intrusion
retrieval (Experiment 3). Collectively, results reveal a robust dissociation
between intrusive and voluntary memories, having ruled out key methodological
differences between how these two memory expressions are assessed, namely cue
overlap (Experiment 1), attentional capture (Experiment 2), and retrieval load
(Experiment 3). We argue that the inability of these retrieval factors to
explain the selective interference is more compatible with separate-trace than
single-trace accounts. Further theoretical developments are needed to account
for this clinically important distinction between intrusive memories and their
voluntary counterpart.</p>

            <p id="P3">Intrusive memories of a traumatic event, or more simply
<italic>intrusions</italic>, comprise the core clinical feature of acute stress
disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <italic>Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fifth ed.
[<italic>DSM–5</italic>]; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 2013</xref>). For example, after a road traffic accident, one may
experience intrusive visual images of a red car zooming toward oneself, accompanied by
disabling fear. The intrusive nature of these emotional memories entails them springing
to mind <italic>involuntarily</italic> (APA, 2013), that is, popping to awareness
unbidden. In contrast, voluntary retrieval of a trauma involves deliberate attempts to
remember the event (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Conway &amp; Pleydell-Pearce, 2000</xref>). Established
evidence-based clinical interventions for PTSD, such as trauma-focused
cognitive–behavioral therapy (<xref rid="R112" ref-type="bibr">National
Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2005</xref>), help to reduce the occurrence
of <italic>intrusive</italic> memories of trauma; however, they do not seek to erase all
memories of the trauma (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Sandberg, &amp;
Iyadurai, 2010</xref>). That is, psychological treatments should ideally preserve
voluntary access to recollections of the trauma so that the patient can discuss their
trauma when required. For example, a trauma victim may be asked to report on the event
for legal reasons; a journalist may need to conjure up details of traumatic events to
pitch a news story; a firefighter may wish to reflect on a trauma for future safety even
if they may not wish the event to intrude. Thus, the impacts of successful therapy are
selective—they may alter some aspects of memory but not others.</p>
            <p id="P4">Experimental psychopathology findings suggest that the impact of a cognitive
intervention on different types of memory of an emotional episode can indeed be
selective: the occurrence of intrusive memories can be altered while leaving voluntary
memory seemingly intact. A series of experiments have shown that, <italic>after</italic>
viewing a trauma film, engaging in certain interference tasks (e.g., performing a
cognitive task such as Tetris game-play after a film reminder cue) reduces the number of
intrusive memories of the film (diary-based measure), but has no detectable effect on
voluntary memory of the same film (as indexed in all of the following studies by spared
performance on recognition memory: <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose, Zhang,
Dejong, Dalgleish, &amp; Holmes, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, Coode-Bate, &amp; Deeprose, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, Kilford, &amp; Deeprose, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>). This <italic>selective
interference effect</italic> on intrusive (involuntary) memory–but not
voluntary memory–has been shown across at least 11 experiments using trauma films
(<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Bourne, Frasquilho, Roth, &amp; Holmes,
2010</xref>: Experiment 1; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Brewin &amp; Saunders,
2001</xref>; Deeprose et al., 2012: Experiment 2; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, Brewin, &amp; Hennessy, 2004</xref>: Experiments 1–3; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, et al., 2010</xref>: Experiments 1 and 2; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Krans, Näring, Holmes, &amp; Becker, 2010</xref>). Interestingly,
intrusive and voluntary memory of a trauma film can also be differentially modulated by
other psychological (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Hagenaars &amp; Arntz,
2012</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Jobson &amp; Dalgleish, 2014</xref>;
<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Krans, Näring, &amp; Becker, 2009; Krans,
Näring, Holmes, &amp; Becker, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">Pearson, Ross, &amp; Webster, 2012</xref>) and pharmacological
procedures (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Bisby, Brewin, Leitz, &amp; Valerie
Curran, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins &amp; Cougle, 2013</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P5">Further experiments have sought to determine the boundary conditions of the
interference effects on intrusive memories. Cognitive interference tasks that are
visuospatial (e.g., complex finger tapping or the computer game Tetris) are claimed to
be more effective than verbal tasks (e.g., counting backward or the computer game Pub
Quiz) in reducing intrusion rates (see <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin,
2014</xref>, for a review), although there are some exceptions (e.g., <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Hagenaars, Holmes, Klaassen, &amp; Elzinga,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Krans, Langner, Reinecke, &amp; Pearson,
2013</xref>). A modality-specific hypothesis has been proposed, which postulates
that sufficiently demanding visuospatial (but not verbal) tasks would preferentially
disrupt the visual imagery that underlines later visual-based intrusions (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, et al.,
2010</xref>). Nevertheless, an alternative line of enquiry suggests that the
important factor is general working memory (WM) load and not modality, which deserves
further exploration (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Engelhard, Van Uijen, &amp; Van
den Hout, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Gunter &amp; Bodner,
2008</xref>; <xref rid="R157" ref-type="bibr">van den Hout &amp; Engelhard,
2012</xref>). In this paper, however, we will restrict ourselves to a visuospatial
task—the computer game Tetris (<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu, Holmes,
Butterfield, &amp; Holmes, 2017</xref>)—which has been used successfully
in many of the aforementioned studies in generating the interference effect.</p>
            <p id="P6">The interference effect on subsequent intrusions of the film occurs when the
cognitive task is performed both <italic>during</italic> (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Bourne et al., 2010</xref>; Holmes et al., 2004; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Krans et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>after</italic> the trauma film,
including minutes to hours after (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al.,
2012</xref>; Holmes et al., 2009; Holmes, James, et al., 2010), and even one to four
days after (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Hagenaars et al., 2017</xref>; James et al.,
2015). In the latter case at longer time intervals, the interference effect is
conditional on the cognitive task being preceded by a reminder cue, which is presumably
needed to reactivate the memory trace such that it is labile and can be disrupted (<xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">Visser, Lau-Zhu, Henson, &amp; Holmes, 2018</xref>).
The necessity of the reminder cue at shorter time intervals (after the film) is unclear,
though it has typically been included in the aforementioned studies. Beyond films with
traumatic content, intrusive memories can also be induced by films with overly positive
(Davies, Malik, Pictet, Blackwell, &amp; Holmes, 2012) or depression-linked material
(<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Lang, Moulds, &amp; Holmes, 2009</xref>). Such
intrusions can be modulated by interference procedures too (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the mechanisms apply to
emotional memories more broadly. Nonetheless, a pivotal issue remains unresolved from
the last two decades of trauma film research: how can such interference tasks
selectively reduce the number of intrusions while leaving voluntary memory intact?</p>
            <p id="P7">The distinction between intrusive (involuntary) memories and their voluntary
counterparts is intriguing, because it is rarely considered by conventional memory
theories. A widely agreed dichotomy is between declarative versus nondeclarative memory
<italic>systems</italic> (<xref rid="R141" ref-type="bibr">Squire, 1992</xref>;
<xref rid="R142" ref-type="bibr">Squire &amp; Zola, 1996</xref>), with
declarative memory often subdivided into episodic versus semantic memory (<xref rid="R151" ref-type="bibr">Tulving, 1972</xref>, <xref rid="R152" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Consistent with this declarative/non-declarative dichotomy, existing
research on emotional memory has shown that nondeclarative memory, for example, the
startle response to fear-eliciting stimuli, can be modulated by a pharmacological
manipulation while leaving declarative memories intact, as indexed for instance by
self-reported fear or learnt contingencies for receiving a shock (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Kindt, Soeter, &amp; Vervliet, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R136" ref-type="bibr">Soeter &amp; Kindt, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="R137" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="R138" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; for a recent review see
<xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2018</xref>). Yet because both
intrusive and voluntary memories of traumatic material entail retrieval of verbalizable
information about the same episode, both would normally be associated with a
declarative/episodic memory system (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen,
2009</xref>; <xref rid="R124" ref-type="bibr">Rubin, Boals, &amp; Berntsen,
2008</xref>; <xref rid="R151" ref-type="bibr">Tulving, 1972</xref>, <xref rid="R152" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). We call such accounts
<italic>single-trace</italic> theories.</p>
            <p id="P8">Note that another common dichotomy is between explicit versus implicit memory
(<xref rid="R125" ref-type="bibr">Schacter, 1987</xref>, <xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), which refers to differences in
<italic>awareness</italic>—the phenomenological experience of retrieving a memory
(regardless of intention). Because intrusions and voluntary retrievals are both
experienced consciously, both would also normally be considered examples of explicit
memory.</p>
            <p id="P9">An alternative class of theories assumes that intrusions and voluntary memories
arise from different memory systems (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Bisby &amp;
Burgess, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, Dalgleish, &amp; Joseph, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, &amp; Burgess, 2010</xref>;
<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs &amp; Nadel, 1998</xref>), some of which
were inspired by other theories proposing independent systems for processing of
imagery-based and non–imagery-based information (e.g., <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Brown &amp; Kulik, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Johnson
&amp; Multhaup, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">Paivio,
1971</xref>). We call these <italic>separate-trace</italic> theories.</p>
            <p id="P10">Below, we first expand on key single-trace and separate-trace accounts and their
predictions regarding selective interference effects. We then elaborate on key
methodological (retrieval-based) differences that might have confounded prior
comparisons of intrusions versus voluntary retrieval. Finally, we introduce how the
present series of experiments address these methodological issues, and therefore inform
the theoretical debate about this clinically important interference effect.</p>

                <title>Single-Trace Theories</title>
                <p id="P11">These theories are mostly drawn from the literature on episodic and
autobiographical memories, with the underlying assumption that both involuntary
and voluntary memories are derived from the same memory system, differing in how
those memories are retrieved based only on differences in retrieval
<italic>intention</italic> (<xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Richardson-Klavehn &amp; Bjork, 1988</xref>) or possibly retrieval
<italic>mode</italic> (<xref rid="R153" ref-type="bibr">Tulving &amp;
Thomson, 1973</xref>). A prominent view, based on the standard consolidation
theory (<xref rid="R143" ref-type="bibr">Squire &amp; Zola-Morgan,
1991</xref>), posits that episodic/declarative memories are initially

over hours or days (<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">McGaugh, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This broad system-level view is
largely silent on the distinction between intrusive and other forms of episodic
memory, and thus would assume that interfering with an episodic trace (through
postencoding interference) should impact both intrusive and voluntary
memories.</p>
                <p id="P12">The same assumption is echoed by key theories on autobiographical
memory, which either propose a self-memory system (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Conway &amp; Pleydell-Pearce, 2000</xref>) with a specialized
storage for rich sensory-perceptual details (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Conway, 2001</xref>), or portray involuntary memory as a basic mode of
remembering (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen &amp; Rubin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R124" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R144" ref-type="bibr">Staugaard &amp; Berntsen, 2014</xref>). Both theories agree
that involuntary and voluntary memories operate on the same memory system,
sharing encoding and consolidation processes, but differing only in retrieval
mechanisms. Thus, these theories would also predict that interfering with an
episodic trace (through postencoding interference) should impact both intrusive
and voluntary memories.</p>

                <p id="P13">Alternative perspectives raise the possibility that more than one memory
trace underlie intrusive and voluntary memory. Such multirepresentational
approaches are prevalent in the clinical literature on information-processing in
PTSD (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Dalgleish, 2004</xref>; for a review), and
have a long tradition in cognitive psychology (e.g., <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Brown &amp; Kulik, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Johnson &amp; Multhaup, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">Paivio, 1971</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P14">One such influential account is dual representation theory (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Brewin et al., 1996</xref>), which proposes that two traces are
formed at the time of trauma: verbally accessible memory (VAM) consisting of
representations of the trauma that are integrated with the wider
autobiographical memory system, and situationally accessible memory (SAM)
consisting primarily of sensory and affective components that are not integrated
in this system. More recent developments of the dual representation theory
propose that intrusive memories are governed by a specialized, long-term
perceptual memory system supporting autobiographical experiences, which can be
only accessed automatically and is separate from the episodic memory system
(<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>). To support this,
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin (2014)</xref> also draws on the
notion that (conscious) reexperiencing symptoms in PTSD result partly from
enhanced perceptual priming of trauma stimuli (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>), which is a form of
<italic>implicit</italic> (unconscious) memory arising from a nondeclarative
memory system (<xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr">Schacter, 1992</xref>). In terms
of neural circuitry, intrusive memory representations are believed to result
from associations between processing in the insula (internal representations of
emotional states) and the dorsal visual stream (sensory representations), via
the potentiated amygdala functioning after stress exposure alongside weakened
hippocampal activity (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Bisby &amp; Burgess,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Brewin et al., 2010</xref>). In
sum, separate-trace accounts—such as dual representation
theory—permit a dissociation between intrusive/involuntary (e.g., SAM;
long-term perceptual representations linked to priming) and voluntary memories
of trauma (e.g., VAM; ordinary episodic representations).</p>

              <title>Discrepancy Between Intrusive (Involuntary) and Voluntary Memory: Methodological
Considerations</title>
              <p id="P15">To explain an interference effect that is selective to intrusions,
single-trace theories need to assume different <italic>retrieval</italic> processes
underlying intrusions and voluntary memories. To demonstrate this, it is important
to control for other differences in the way intrusions and voluntary memories are
assessed, beyond the involuntary-voluntary dichotomy (the so-called retrieval
intentionality criterion; <xref rid="R127" ref-type="bibr">Schacter, Bowers,
&amp; Booker, 1989</xref>). The previous trauma-film studies demonstrating
selective interference have failed to consider the methodological differences that
are inherent to most commonly used measures of intrusions (e.g., diaries) versus
voluntary memory (e.g., recognition tasks). Thus, the main aim of the present study
was to improve methodology by better matching the types of measures of memory, with
the possibility that interference effects (putatively on consolidation of the memory
trace) would then no longer dissociate involuntary from voluntary memory, supporting
the hypothesis that interference affects the same underlying trace as assumed by
single-trace accounts. However, if the selective interference on intrusions still
occurs when controlling for differences in retrieval factors across measures, then
separate-trace theories would seem more likely than single-trace theories.</p>
              <p id="P16">Informed by foundational memory theories (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley, Eysenck, &amp; Anderson, 2009</xref>), as well as prominent
accounts on involuntary autobiographical memory (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>), we have identified differences between intrusion
diaries and recognition tasks in three key aspects in the retrieval context or
retrieval factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which could
explain the selective interference (i.e., the apparent intrusion/recognition
dissociation due to interference tasks found in trauma-film studies). <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley and colleagues (2009)</xref> presented seven
textbook retrieval principles, three of which we considered in our study, namely
retrieval mode (i.e., retrieval intention), cue-target strength (i.e., cue overlap),
and attention to cues (i.e., a combination of attentional capture and retrieval
load). These principles also broadly overlap with those considered important for
involuntary memories as postulated by <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen
(2009)</xref>, namely retrieval intention, external cues, and attentional
factors (cue saliency and diffuse attentional state). We expand on these below.</p>
              <sec id="S5">
                <title>Cue Overlap</title>
                <p id="P17">This retrieval factor refers to the overlap between information
presented at retrieval (e.g., retrieval cues) and information presented at
encoding (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley et al., 2009</xref>). It is
established that the greater the retrieval-encoding overlap, the greater the
chance of retrieving the full memory (<xref rid="R153" ref-type="bibr">Tulving
&amp; Thomson, 1973</xref>). A recognition task typically asks
participants to distinguish old items that they encountered previously from new
items that they did not. The <italic>old</italic> items can be <italic>copy
cues</italic>, such as stills from the trauma film (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">James,
Lau-Zhu, Tickle, Horsch, &amp; Holmes, 2016</xref>). In contrast, copy
cues are absent in the diary measure.</p>
                <p id="P18">Some may argue that intrusions can be triggered by incidental cues in
everyday life (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Conway, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R106" ref-type="bibr">Michael, Ehlers, Halligan, &amp; Clark,
2005</xref>)—for example, when passing a red car in the street that
resembles the one that was seen to crash in a trauma film—but these cues
are unlikely to perfectly match visual elements of the original film like copy
cues. The high cue-overlap in an experimental recognition task is arguably more
effective at aiding access to visual memories than the low cue-overlap in
everyday cues that prompt intrusions. If so, recognition tasks could be more
robust to weakening of a memory trace, removing any effect of interference, and
resulting in an interference effect that appears selective to the intrusion
diary.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S6">
                <title>Attentional Capture</title>
                <p id="P19">This retrieval factor refers to the extent that initial exogenous
attention is given to potential retrieval cues (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley et al., 2009</xref>). Attention to relevant/salient sensory cues
is considered to be a prominent retrieval route (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza, Ciaramelli, Olson, &amp; Moscovitch, 2008</xref>). The
autobiographical memory literature also supports the notion that salient cues
(e.g., attributable to motivational factors such as worries and everyday
concerns) raise the probability of involuntary memories coming to mind (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P20">In typical recognition tasks, attention is initially focused on the
external retrieval cues as per instructions. In contrast, one could argue that
in everyday life (e.g., diary measure), the initial focus of attention is rarely
on potential cues; one is instead focusing on another task at hand. Such
initially unattended cues, however, may subsequently capture attention, and then
increase the likelihood of cue-elicited intrusions. The interference task may
reduce intrusion likelihood by disrupting the extent of such attentional
capture. Thus, it is at least conceivable that such a disruption of attentional
capture is irrelevant to tasks in which attention is already oriented to cues
(e.g., no attentional capture in recognition tasks, hence apparent spared
performance), but is more apparent when cues are initially unattended (e.g., as
assumed for the diary intrusions).</p>

                <title>Retrieval Load</title>
                <p id="P21">This retrieval factor refers to the amount of cognitive resources
available during retrieval to support the activation of the memory trace (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley et al., 2009</xref>), including
goal-directed retrieval (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza et al.,
2008</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Conway &amp;
Pleydell-Pearce, 2000</xref>). The more resources available, the more these
can be dedicated for memory activation. For example, resources in WM appear to
be help form and maintain mental imagery (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley &amp; Andrade, 2000</xref>). Further, diffuse attentional
states (e.g., low task demands leaving cognitive resources available) can
promote involuntary recollections (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Ball,
2007</xref>; Barzykowski &amp; Niedźwieńska, 2018; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R130" ref-type="bibr">Schlagman &amp; Kvavilashvili, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R159" ref-type="bibr">Vannucci, Pelagatti, Hanczakowski, Mazzoni,
&amp; Paccani, 2015</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P22">One could argue that tasks assessing for recognition memory consume
cognitive resources, especially if retrieval involves recollection (<xref rid="R167" ref-type="bibr">Yonelinas, 2002</xref>). In contrast, intrusive
imagery-based memories might be more likely to be reported in the diary when
relatively more WM resources are available (because task demands are low).
Hence, variations in the strength of a memory trace might be more apparent in
retrieval contexts that encourage (intrusive) memory activation in the first
place (e.g., presumably in low retrieval-load in the diary), which in turn could
more sensitive to reveal interference effects. In contrast, such variations
might be less apparent in retrieval contexts that leave fewer resources for
intrusive memory activation (e.g., presumably high retrieval-load in recognition
tasks; possibly also in other involuntary-based tasks, e.g., see Experiment
2).</p>

              <title>Overview of Experiments</title>
              <p id="P23">In the present series of experiments, we addressed the above three retrieval
factors, which may have confounded previous comparisons of involuntary versus
voluntary memory for traumatic film material. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2</xref> provides an overview of the procedure across experiments. In all
experiments, participants watched a film with traumatic content, and then after a
short delay, one group received film reminder cues followed by interference, that
is, Tetris game-play (<italic>reminder-plus-Tetris</italic> group). The second
(control) group received the film reminder cues but then sat quietly
(<italic>reminder-only</italic> group). In line with previous studies (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2012</xref>; Holmes et al., 2009;
Holmes, James, et al., 2010), we chose a 30-min delay between encoding and
interference, as this is thought to fall within the time window of memory
consolidation (up to 6 h postencoding; Nader, <xref rid="R128" ref-type="bibr">Schafe, &amp; Le Doux, 2000</xref>), in which the memory is hypothesized to
remain labile after encoding. Relevant to clinical translation, a 30-min delay is
also considered reasonable time after an event to allow someone to be reached by
postaccident and emergency interventions in the United Kingdom (National Audit
Office, 2017) and the United States (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Carr, Branas,
Metlay, Sullivan, &amp; Camargo, 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P24">Memory for the trauma film was then assessed by a battery of memory tasks,
which were administered at two time points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2</xref>): soon after the interference task within the same first session
(Experiments 2 and 3) and/or a week later at follow-up (Experiments 1 and 2). The
combination of these memory tasks was designed to address key methodological
differences in retrieval factors (mainly cue overlap, attentional capture, and
retrieval load) between the intrusion diary (measure of involuntary memory) and
typical recognition memory tasks (measure of voluntary memory), as we explain in
more detail later for each experiment.</p>
              <p id="P25">Overall, we predicted fewer intrusions in the reminder-plus-Tetris group
than the reminder-only group, but no difference between groups on recognition memory
(Experiments 1 and 2). If some of the other new memory measures revealed an
interference effect (in addition to the intrusion diary), then this would help
isolate those retrieval factors that are important to allow for an apparent
selective interference on intrusions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure
1</xref>). For example, finding that an interference task <italic>does</italic>
affect voluntary memory when there is low cue-overlap comparable to the intrusion
diary (e.g., free-recall task in Experiment 1) would furthermore support
single-trace accounts, which assume that the selectivity of interference arises at
the time of retrieval (i.e., a matter of differential sensitivity to accessing the
trace, which is removed once key retrieval factors are controlled for). Moreover,
establishing that the size of the interference effect on intrusive/involuntary
memory varies—depending on specific retrieval contexts—would also
point toward retrieval factors that can produce an apparent selective interference
on intrusions, assuming that measures of voluntary memory are unmatched to measures
of intrusive/involuntary memory in such factors. If, however, an obvious retrieval
factor cannot be identified that differentiates the memory measures (other than
voluntary vs. involuntary), then the results would be more consistent with
separate-trace theories, in which postencoding interference is allowed to affect one
memory system but not the other.</p>

              <title>Experiment 1: Cue Overlap</title>
              <p id="P26">The first aim of Experiment 1 was to replicate the pattern of selective
interference on intrusive memory while sparing recognition memory (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2012</xref>; Holmes et al., 2009;
Holmes, James, et al., 2010; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al.,
2015</xref>). The second aim was to test whether differences found between
intrusions versus recognition genuinely reflected a distinction between involuntary
versus voluntary retrieval (retrieval intention), rather than simply the effect of
having higher cue-overlap in the recognition task (<xref rid="R153" ref-type="bibr">Tulving &amp; Thomson, 1973</xref>) than in the diary. We tested this by
factorially crossing retrieval intention with degree of cue overlap. This two-by-two
factorial design was completed by adding two new memory measures of the film: free
recall and perceptual priming (see the Method section for details). Whereas the
diary can be considered as an <italic>involuntary</italic> measure with
<italic>low</italic> cue-overlap, recognition memory can be considered as a
<italic>voluntary</italic> measure with <italic>high</italic> cue-overlap; free
recall can be considered example of a <italic>voluntary</italic> measure (like
recognition) but with <italic>low</italic> cue-overlap (like the diary), while
priming can be considered as example of an <italic>involuntary</italic> measure
(like the diary) but with <italic>high</italic> cue-overlap (like recognition). Each
participant completed all these four measures.</p>

                <title>Hypotheses</title>
                <p id="P27">We predicted that the reminder-plus-Tetris group would have
significantly fewer diary intrusions (summed across Days 1–7) compared
with the reminder-only (control) group, but there would be no significant group
differences on recognition performance (Day 8). If this were found, then two
following alternative hypotheses were investigated. If the intrusion/recognition
dissociation reflects methodological differences in cue overlap, then the
reminder-plus-Tetris group (compared with the reminder-only group) would also
show reduced voluntary memory in the context of low cue-overlap (lack of copy
cues), that is, reduced performance on free recall. Alternatively, if the
intrusion/recognition dissociation reflects a genuine distinction between
involuntary and voluntary memory, then we predicted that the
reminder-plus-Tetris group (compared with the reminder-only group) would also
show reduced involuntary memory even with high cue-overlap, that is, reduced
degree of priming.</p>

To encourage the use of mental rotation (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai, Blackwell, et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), participants were instructed to pay

of the screen, which were due to fall after the one being played. They
were told to use their mind’s eye to work out the best way to
manipulate and place the blocks to achieve a line. The game was adaptive
with individual’s performance (i.e., becoming more difficult as
participants’ scores increased). Tetris was played in marathon
mode (with 15 levels) and with the sound off. We did not collect data on
performance—ways to measure performance are limited in the
scoring constraints of this commercial game (e.g., scoring is not linear

James, et al., 2010; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al.,
2015</xref>), participants were asked to note down their intrusions
over a 1-week period after film viewing. Both verbal and written
instructions were given on how to complete the diary. An intrusive
memory was defined as “visual images, sounds and bodily
sensations related to the film” and that “pop into mind
without one expecting it”; such images could range from
“fuzzy and fragmented to vivid and as clear as normal
vision”. They were told not to include memories of the film that
were retrieved deliberately. The diary was split by days, and within
each day into three time periods (morning, afternoon and evening).
Participants were instructed to keep the diary with them, and note down
the intrusion (in a tick box) as soon as it occurred within the
corresponding period, and also any associated trigger cues they could
have identified. For each intrusion, they wrote down a brief description
(e.g., an image of the eye operation) that was later used to verify
whether the intrusion was indeed from the film or not. Participants were
also asked to set aside regular times for each period to review the
diary and encouraged to note down ‘0’ if no intrusions
occurred in that period. The main outcome was the total count of
intrusive image-based memories. Because intrusion rates on individual
days are typically low, our main outcome was the total number of
intrusive image-based memories summed across a 1-week period (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2012</xref>; Holmes et

Autobiographical Interview (AI; Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, &amp;
Moscovitch, 2002) were adapted to free recall of the trauma film (see
the online supplemental materials for further details). The AI has been
shown to have high interrater reliability (0.88 to 0.96) for scoring
autobiographical memories, real-life traumatic memories in PTSD (<xref rid="R104" ref-type="bibr">McKinnon et al., 2015</xref>), and
memories of nontrauma film footage (<xref rid="R145" ref-type="bibr">St-Laurent, Moscovitch, Jadd, &amp; McAndrews, 2014</xref>).
Detailed written instructions were presented on the screen to guide
recall and participants were instructed to verbalize their responses
using tape recorder. There were two recall phases. First (free recall),
participants were instructed to retrieve as many details as possible
from the film; they were told to recall the clips in any order and were
allowed a 10-min period. No additional retrieval cues were given at this
stage. Afterward (specific probing), participants were given cue phrases
for each of the 11 scenes in a randomized fixed order, and were allowed
a 2-min period for each scene to retrieve additional details.</p>
                    <p id="P37">Verbalizations were subsequently transcribed and followed a
process of text segmentation into details—meaningful units of
information (<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al.,
2002</xref>). Nonepisodic content was not counted, such as general
opinions and comments in relation to other events (e.g., “these
things shouldn’t happen to people”). Accurate episodic
details were identified, meaning details that pertained directly to what
actually took place in the film (<xref rid="R145" ref-type="bibr">St-Laurent et al., 2014</xref>), and further categorized into
either <italic>event</italic> or <italic>perceptual</italic> details.
The main outcome was the total number of episodic details. This task was
deemed to index voluntary retrieval with low cue-overlap (relative to
recognition and priming).</p>

                    <p id="P38">The stimuli consisted of two sets of 90 stills (different to the
stills used as film reminder cues). One set contained stills drawn from
the trauma film; another set contained foil stills selected based on
similarity to the film stills in content and themes (i.e., death and
injury). Each still was split along the midline, producing two
still-halves (for a schematic see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure
3</xref>; see the online supplemental materials for further
details). In a given trial, two still-halves were presented
simultaneously. These still-halves, when put together, could either
recompose into the same original still (75% of trials—match
response), or be from completely unrelated stills (25% of
trials—mismatch response). Participants were asked to judge
whether the two still-halves were a match or a mismatch. There were a
total of 144 trials. Pairings of still-halves for each trial were fixed,
and the order of the trials was randomized.</p>
                    <p id="P39">Each trial started with a fixation cross in the middle of a gray
screen for 2 sec, followed by the still-halves. A continuous
identification paradigm was applied (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Berry, Shanks, &amp; Henson, 2008</xref>): the still-halves were
initially covered by salt-and-pepper noise (black and white pixels
superimposed on the still), and then became progressively clearer over 6
sec, as 20% of the noise pixels were removed every 1250 msec. The fully
revealed still-halves remained on screen for up to 2 sec further.
Participants could make a response at any point in these 8 sec (either
with some noise or fully clear), with the trial terminating upon a
response.</p>
                    <p id="P40">We reasoned that reaction time (RT) to still-halves would be
faster (i.e., decisions made at higher levels of noise) for trials with
stills of the trauma film than trials with foil stills. This would occur
even though no reference was made to prior exposure to films (i.e.,
participants would show perceptual priming), rendering this task an
indirect measure that is unlikely to involve voluntary retrieval (<xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Richardson-Klavehn &amp; Bjork,

possible. After each still, participants were also asked to provide a

                <p id="P53">Experiment 1 investigated, for participants who viewed a trauma film,
the effect of performing an interference task (following a film reminder cue) 30
min after the film on the subsequent memory of that film. Memory was assessed by
a battery of measures that differed in retrieval intention (involuntary vs.
voluntary) and cue overlap (low vs. high). Confirming our first prediction, and
replicating previous studies (Holmes et al., 2009; Holmes, James, et al., 2010),
the reminder-plus-Tetris group reported fewer intrusive memories in the diary
(involuntary memory with low cue-overlap) than the reminder-only group, whereas
no significant group differences were found in accuracy on a recognition task
(voluntary memory with high cue-overlap).</p>
                <p id="P54">Regarding the novel hypothesis about the role of cue overlap, there were
no significant differences between the reminder-plus-Tetris group and
reminder-only group for the new memory tasks, namely, free recall (voluntary
with low cue-overlap) and priming (involuntary with high cue-overlap). Indeed, a
significant three-way interaction supported the inference that there was
interference only on the number of intrusions (in line also with analyses using
a Bayesian approach; see the online supplemental materials). These findings
suggest that cue overlap (at least as operationalized in this experiment) cannot
explain the interference effect. Nor can involuntary retrieval alone, as
interference was not observed on all involuntary measures. Thus, a combination
of involuntary retrieval and low cue-overlap appears necessary to explain the
interference effect, and/or the intrusion diary differs from the other three
memory tasks along some other dimension (as explored in Experiments 2 and 3
later).</p>
                <p id="P55">There were no interference effects on free recall, even though (as with
the intrusion diary) it lacked copy cues from the trauma film (like those
provided for the recognition task). As noted in the Introduction, this is not to
deny that some types of cue were present to trigger the diary intrusions outside
the laboratory. Indeed, participants reported that diary intrusions were
triggered by everyday (external/environmental) cues (see online supplemental
materials), consistent with the broad literature on involuntary autobiographical
memories (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, Staugaard, &amp; Sørensen,

&amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R105" ref-type="bibr">Michael et
al., 2005</xref>). It is also possible that the potential for cue-memory
overlap is broad (<xref rid="R159" ref-type="bibr">Vannucci et al.,
2015</xref>), so that everyday cues triggering diary intrusions do not
necessarily have lower cue-overlap. Nonetheless, if the key to an interference
effect were only the combination of some type of retrieval cue (whether copy or
not, which is present even for diary intrusions) and involuntary recall, then we
should have observed an interference effect in priming, which we did not. Thus,
we reasoned that another dimension in relation to cue processing (beyond cue
overlap) ought to be considered, which can better account the selective
interference. We addressed one possibility in Experiment 2, where we directly
assessed the degree of attentional capture by retrieval cues (as well as
providing those cues in a better-controlled laboratory assessment of intrusions,
in the form of a novel vigilance-intrusion task).</p>
                <p id="P56">Although the use of different memory tasks in the current experiment was
mainly to manipulate cue overlap/retrieval intention, these tasks also provide
additional theoretical information. Free recall, for example, provided some
further methodological advantages in relation to recognition tasks. Recognition
memory is thought to involve both <italic>recollection</italic> of episodic
information and a nonepisodic feeling of <italic>familiarity</italic> (<xref rid="R167" ref-type="bibr">Yonelinas, 2002</xref>), where the latter might
arise from recent activation of parts of semantic memory. One could argue that
the interference task disrupts recollection (episodic details) but not
familiarity, such that recognition performance in the reminder-plus-Tetris group
was preserved because of an intact familiarity process. The lack of interference
on our free-recall task rules out this possibility. We isolated episodic (event
and perceptual) content in the freely recalled transcripts by adapting a
standardized method (<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2002</xref>;
<xref rid="R104" ref-type="bibr">McKinnon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R145" ref-type="bibr">St-Laurent et al., 2014</xref>), and were still
unable to find an interference effect. The lack of interference on recollection
processes is further supported by the absence of group differences in additional
exploratory analyses on recognition performance, either by confidence ratings in
Experiment 1, or also by remember and know judgments in Experiment 2 (see online
supplemental materials).</p>
                <p id="P57">Our lack of interference effect on priming may be at odds with some
clinical accounts. Enhanced perceptual priming of trauma stimuli has been
theorized to underline later intrusion development (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Holz, Lass-Hennemann, Streb, Pfaltz, &amp; Michael,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="R146" ref-type="bibr">Sündermann, Hauschildt,
&amp; Ehlers, 2013</xref>), and also affect the long-term perceptual
memory system governing intrusive symptoms according to the dual representation
theory (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>). Instead, we found
a reduction in intrusion rates despite an apparent lack of interference effects
on priming. We return to such broader theoretical implications in the General
Discussion.</p>
                <p id="P58">An unaddressed confound is the different in delay interval between film
watching and completing the different memory tasks. The diary score was summed
over Days 1 to 7 after the film (to obtain enough intrusions for statistical
analyses), whereas the scores on the other three measures were all acquired on
Day 8. It is possible that the interference effect is short-lived, affecting
retrieval early on (e.g., for a few days after encoding) but not later (e.g., a
week after encoding), which would produce the current pattern of results. When
we attempted to match the delay across all memory measures in a post hoc
analysis—by restricting the diary data to just Day 7 (see online
supplemental materials)—the critical three-way interaction (i.e., bigger
interference effects on diary intrusions than on other measures) was no longer
significant. However, we think this is likely to reflect unreliable estimates of
intrusion rates, given the low number of intrusions on a single (final) day in
the diary (for which the average number of intrusions in the reminder-only group
was less than one; see the online supplemental materials). Further, the
selective interference effect has already been demonstrated even when both
assessments of recognition and intrusions were matched on delay (i.e., both
assessed on Day 8 in the laboratory; and using an intrusion provocation task),
albeit when a postencoding interference was 24 h after the trauma film (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, we also
attempted to assess intrusion and voluntary memory with better-matched delays in
Experiment 2.</p>
                <p id="P59">Finally, in a fixed-order design as ours, it is possible that delivery
of one memory measure may have contaminated later ones. For example, a group
difference in an earlier memory measure might spill over to cause an artifactual
group difference in subsequent measures. This was not the case in our
experiment, because the intrusion diary (the first measure administered) showed
a group difference, but the subsequent measures did not. It is also possible
that the reverse contamination happens, such that a group difference in one
measure (e.g., intrusion diary) masks a real group difference in subsequent
measures, for example, by promoting rehearsal (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Ball, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Mace, 2014</xref>). To
help address this possibility of order effects, we included measures of
intrusions both <italic>before</italic> and <italic>after</italic> other memory
measures in the next experiment.</p>

              <title>Experiment 2: Attentional Capture</title>
              <p id="P60">Selective interference on diary intrusions in Experiment 1—but not on
any of the other measures of memory—suggests that neither the diary’s
involuntary aspect, nor its low cue-overlap (at least in terms of lacking copy cues
relative to the recognition task using film stills), can fully account for the
interference effect. The main aim of Experiment 2 was to investigate an alternative
possibility, namely that interference disrupts the ability of external cues to
capture attention, thereby reducing access to the memory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To take an example from an intrusion diary: having a
red vehicle pass by—that is similar in some respects to what was seen in the
trauma film—may attract the person’s attention and trigger an
intrusion, even though that vehicle was not originally the focus of attention (e.g.,
because that person was working at a cafe). When those cues are already the center
of attention (as in the recognition or priming task in Experiment 1), there may not
be scope for an interference effect to be revealed. Our consideration of attentional
capture also chimes with the wider literature linking preferential processing of
trauma/threat-related cues with the development of stress-related psychopathologies
(<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R114" ref-type="bibr">Öhman, Flykt, &amp; Esteves, 2001</xref>),
including intrusive symptoms (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark,
2000</xref>; <xref rid="R105" ref-type="bibr">Michael &amp; Ehlers,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="R146" ref-type="bibr">Sündermann et al.,
2013</xref>; <xref rid="R161" ref-type="bibr">Verwoerd, Wessel, de Jong,
&amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2009</xref>). Attentional capture is typically thought as
automatic (involuntary) and nonconscious, so one may not always be aware of
potential cues (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>).
To investigate the role of attentional capture in explaining the interference
effects, we directly measured the degree of attentional capture using a novel
adaptation of the dot-probe task (<xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">MacLeod, Mathews,
&amp; Tata, 1986</xref>; see Methods for further details).</p>
              <p id="P61">The second aim of Experiment 2 was to address the potential confounds of
both retrieval delay and order of the measures, which may have affected the results
of Experiment 1. To enable this, we assessed intrusions within the laboratory (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu, Holmes, &amp; Porcheret, 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="R149" ref-type="bibr">Takarangi, Strange, &amp; Lindsay,
2014</xref>), devising a method we call the <italic>vigilance-intrusion</italic>
task, based on a go/no-go paradigm (see the Method section for further details).
Intrusions here occur in the context of a task (albeit low-demanding)—rather
than during rest (as in <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al.,
2015</xref>)—so opportunities for contamination from voluntary retrieval
might be reduced (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al., 2018</xref>).
Because this task furnished a sufficient number of intrusions in a short timeframe
(10 min), we were able to administer it twice: on Day 1, immediately before the
attentional-capture task, and on Day 8, immediately before the recognition task (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This design helped improve match
in delay (both intrusion and recognition assessed on Day 8) and account for order
effects (intrusions assessed before <italic>and</italic> after attentional capture).
It also allowed us to explore whether interference on intrusions varies depending on
delays (e.g., immediately vs. a week later).</p>
              <sec id="S36">
                <title>Hypotheses</title>
                <p id="P62">Replicating Experiment 1, we predicted that the reminder-plus-Tetris
group would have fewer diary intrusions (Days 1–7) than the reminder-only
group, but show comparable performance on recognition (Day 8; i.e., the
selective interference effect). We also predicted fewer intrusions in the
reminder-plus-Tetris group for the new vigilance-intrusion task, at least on Day
8, which would replicate that pattern of intrusion/recognition dissociation on
Day 8 found by <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al. (2015)</xref>. Novel
to this experiment, we predicted that, if the interference task affects the
ability of cues to attract attention, then the reminder-plus-Tetris group would
show reduced attentional capture to trauma-film cues (see the Method section),
in parallel to reduced intrusion rates. The importance of this retrieval factor
in explaining access to the memory trace would be more consistent with
single-trace accounts, without the need to invoke separate-trace accounts (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

foil stills: film stills were drawn from the trauma film and were
similar in content to the film reminder cues; foil stills depicted a
variety of colored indoor/outdoor scenes. All stills were altered using
Gaussian Blur 2.0 (thus were not exact replicas of the film). This
blurring procedure was intended to emulate cues glimpsed in daily life
when they are outside of one’s focus of attention (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>), and was used

a black background screen for 250 msec (see the online supplemental

for a further 1500 msec. Participants were instructed to press the
‘Go’ key using the desktop keyboard for digits between
‘1’ to ‘9,’ but withhold their response for
‘3’ (occurring 11% of the time). Every three trials
starting from the first, a foil still appeared behind the digit (instead
of a black background). Participants were told that, in addition to the
digits, they may also encounter background scenes, but no responses to
the scenes were required. Both digits and scene stills were presented in
a fixed randomized order.</p>
                    <p id="P68">Participants were told that intrusive memories from the film
(using the same definition of intrusions as used with the diary) might
pop up spontaneously at any time during the vigilance task. In that
case, they were instructed to press the Intrusion key using the keyboard
to pause the vigilance task and note down a brief description of the
intrusion’s content (so it could be later verified as with the
diary). They then resumed the vigilance task by pressing a button on the
keyboard to complete any remaining trials. Task duration was around 9
min (but time was added when participant paused to record an intrusion).
Viewing distance was 60 cm approximately from the screen. The main
outcome was the total number of intrusive memories throughout the

The stimuli consisted of two sets of 96 stills, one set for the trauma
films and the other for foils (as described for the priming task in
Experiment 1). For each set, half of the stills were categorized as
emotional stills and half as neutral stills (based on a negative
emotionality index obtained from independent norming on participants who
had not seen the trauma film). The task had four runs with 96 trials
using the entire stimulus set per run. A trial consisted of a pairing
between a film and foil still matched on emotionality ratings.</p>
                    <p id="P70">Each trial began with a central fixation cross for 1000 msec
followed by the still pair for either 500 msec or 1000 msec. Each still
appeared to the left and right of the cross, respectively. The still
pair then disappeared, and a small visual target (a dot probe) was
presented in the location where one of the stills was shown.
Participants were asked to judge as quickly and as accurately as
possible whether the target had one or two small dots. Each dot
subtended at a visual angle of 0.10 ȕ 0.10 degrees approximately
(see the online supplemental materials). The trial terminated upon
response. An error-triggered delay message appeared for every mistake
(for 5 sec) before participants moved on to the next trial. The location
of each still type was randomized across trials. Specific pairings
between stills were randomized across participants. The background color
remained dark gray throughout the task. Viewing distance was
approximately 60 cm from the screen. The main outcome was
<italic>attentional bias</italic> toward film stills over foil
stills, as expressed by the degree to which the speed of correct target
discrimination was quicker when the target was presented in the location

scores were calculated for each participant according to still
emotionality type, by obtaining the RT difference for responding to
targets sharing location with foil stills versus targets sharing
location with trauma film stills. Positive scores indicated a faster
response—thus a bias—for trauma film stills. Such a
trauma-film bias was significant within each group (one-tailed) for
emotional still-pairs only, <italic>t</italic>s(17) &gt; 1.80,

was pronounced for film cues depicting emotional content.
Nevertheless, there was no significant group differences in
attentional bias to trauma-film cues (of emotional scenes),

                      <p id="P81"><italic>Comparing intrusions and attentional capture on Day
1.</italic> The lack of a group difference on attentional biases
was unexpected, given that we found a group difference on intrusions
assessed during a similar time period (i.e., soon after interference
on Day 1). Therefore, we directly compared the interference effect
on intrusions versus attentional bias. As with Experiment 1, a
single outcome was selected from each memory task and compared using
standardized <italic>z</italic> scores in the same analysis
(<italic>z</italic> scored across all participants, i.e., in
both groups). We selected the number of early laboratory-intrusions
on the vigilance-intrusion task, and the attentional-bias score to
trauma film stills (across both emotional and neutral still pairs).
A 2 (between-groups: reminder-plus-Tetris and reminder-only) ȕ

                    <p id="P82">We tested whether the interference task reduces intrusive
memories via a reduction in attention capture—the ability of
film-related cues in the environment to capture attention. If so, then
we expected that, alongside an interference effect on intrusions, an
interference effect would also be revealed on the degree of attentional
capture to trauma-film cues (measured by RTs in the adapted dot-probe
task). This new task was sensitive enough to detect an attentional bias
to trauma-film cues relative to matched foil stills that had not been
seen before (provided those stills depicted emotional scenes of the
trauma film). However, there were no significant group differences in
the size of this attentional capture, despite a significant group
difference in the number of laboratory intrusions assessed within the
same period (Day 1). Indeed, a combined (<italic>z</italic> scored)
analysis showed a significant interaction in the direction of a greater
interference effect on intrusions relative to the degree of attentional
capture (also see the online supplemental materials for analyses using a
Bayesian approach). Importantly, the interference effect on intrusions
remained even though intrusions were assessed before (in the
vigilance-intrusion task on Day 1) <italic>and</italic> after (in the
diary and the vigilance-intrusion task on Day 8) the attentional-capture
task within our overall procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), addressing the potential task-order confound of
Experiment 1 where intrusions were assessed only first. Hence, these
findings suggest that the degree of attentional capture by potential
retrieval cues is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between intrusions
and other memory measures in neither Experiment 2 (recognition) nor
Experiment 1 (recall, recognition and priming), despite potential
attentional differences between measures.</p>
                    <p id="P83">The lack of association between intrusions and attentional
capture may be at odds with research linking attentional biases and
stress-related psychopathology (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers
&amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">Mathews
&amp; MacLeod, 2005</xref>; Michael &amp; Ehlers, 2007; <xref rid="R114" ref-type="bibr">Öhman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R146" ref-type="bibr">Sündermann et al., 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="R161" ref-type="bibr">Verwoerd et al., 2009</xref>).
Note, however, that our attention-capture task used copy cues of the
event, unlike other types of cues in past studies (e.g., words or
noncopy pictures). Thus, intrusions and attentional bias may still be
related through other measures/domains, and other manipulations may be
able to reduce intrusion rates via changes in attentional capture (<xref rid="R160" ref-type="bibr">Verwoerd, Wessel, &amp; de Jong,
2012</xref>; <xref rid="R161" ref-type="bibr">Verwoerd et al.,
2009</xref>), but these do not seem to apply to the current
selective interference effect.</p>
                    <p id="P84">Experiment 2 provided further confirmation of the selective
interference on intrusions while sparing voluntary memory. We found that
the reminder-plus-Tetris group reported fewer intrusions than the
reminder-only group according to (a) a 1-week diary, replicating
Experiment 1 as well as previous studies (e.g., Holmes et al., 2009,
2010; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>), (b) a
vigilance-intrusion task performed on Day 8 (replicating <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>), and (c) a
vigilance-intrusion task on Day 1 (novel to this experiment). Yet the
groups showed equivalent recognition performance. The greater number of
intrusions provided by the vigilance-intrusion task (relative to diary)
also meant that we could directly compare measures within similar period
(Day 8)—as in <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al.
(2015)</xref>—addressing the potential confound in Experiment
1 where intrusions and recognition were assessed at different delays
after the trauma film. Moreover, both measures were further matched by
both being assessed within the laboratory context, whereas in most
studies to date they have been assessed in different contexts (i.e., the
diary being conducted in daily life; <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). A combined analysis on Day 8 also
showed a significantly greater interference effect on laboratory
intrusions than recognition performance. Together, this pattern of
findings reinforces the claim that the intrusion/recognition
dissociation is indeed genuine, despite not being predicted by
single-trace memory theories. Therefore, what remains
critical—besides continuing to demonstrate this
involuntary/voluntary dissociation—is to identify what retrieval
factors modulate the size of the interference effect on intrusions per
se (as we attempt in Experiment 3).</p>
                    <p id="P85">An intriguing finding—established for the first time
here—is that the impact of the interference task on intrusions
could be observed early on, just <italic>minutes</italic> after the
intervention was carried out (within the same laboratory session as film
viewing and interference). These findings suggest that the interference
effect is both immediate and long-term, despite alternative claims that
emotional memory effects only emerge at longer delay intervals, for
example, after consolidation has taken place (e.g., <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Dudai, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R110" ref-type="bibr">Nader et al., 2000</xref>). We return to this issue in the General
Discussion. Furthermore, variations in early intrusions also predicted
the number of intrusions in the subsequent week-long diary across groups
(see the online supplemental materials). Hence for now we have
established that the vigilance-intrusion task administered within the
first laboratory session can serve as an analogue for a subsequent
1-week diary. This allows for single-session experiments without the
need for participants to return at a later date (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R149" ref-type="bibr">Takarangi et al., 2014</xref>), and obviates the
potential burden of keeping a 1-week diary. We therefore exploited and
extended the vigilance-intrusion task in Experiment 3.</p>
                    <p id="P86">A potential concern is that participants who experienced more
intrusions (i.e., the reminder-only group) necessarily paused the
vigilance-intrusion task more often to provide intrusions’
descriptions. One might wonder whether more pausing also allowed more
time to be spent on, for example, ruminating about the films, which in
turn could have inflated the intrusion rates in the reminder-only group.
We addressed this concern in Experiment 3 by removing the need to
verbally describe intrusions, given that we already confirmed here that
participants can indeed correctly identify intrusive memories of the
film.</p>
                    <p id="P87">One may also wonder why attentional capture was not assessed
within the vigilance-intrusion task, and/or why intrusions were not
assessed within the attentional capture (dot-probe) task, to maximize
comparability. The vigilance-intrusion task involved a low-demand task
which results in performance levels close to ceiling, presumably
providing little room to simultaneously measure any attentional capture
(since its purpose was to occupy participants just enough to minimize
opportunities for voluntary retrieval). The dot-probe task, by contrast,
needed to be sufficiently challenging to measure attentional capture,
which might be compromised if participants were additionally required to
report intrusions concurrently. Nevertheless, future experimental
adaptations may enable simultaneous measurement of intrusions and other
forms of attentional capture (e.g., <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Barzykowski &amp; Niedźwieńska, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R158" ref-type="bibr">Vannucci, Batool, Pelagatti, &amp;
Mazzoni, 2014</xref>). Instead, however, we tested the remaining
retrieval factor identified in the General Introduction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) in the next experiment,
namely whether the level of retrieval load modulated the interference
effect.</p>

                <title>Experiment 3: Retrieval Load</title>
                <p id="P88">Given that Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that neither cue overlap nor
attentional capture are able to explain the interference effect on intrusions,
the main aim of Experiment 3 was to investigate the role of retrieval load (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)—specifically the
possibility that the interference effect is unique to retrieval contexts with
low cognitive-demands (henceforth low <italic>retrieval-load</italic>) and
absent (or smaller) in contexts with higher cognitive-demands. Note that load
here refers to load during <italic>retrieval</italic> (i.e., while memory is
being assessed) and not at other time points (e.g., the load imposed by Tetris
game-play to presumably disrupt consolidation). As alluded to before, the main
difference between the vigilance-intrusion task and the attentional-capture task
was that the first involved a monotonous task (i.e., low retrieval-load),
whereas the second emphasized speed and accuracy with performance feedback
(i.e., high retrieval-load), which may have left fewer resources for a memory
trace to be activated (e.g., for intrusions to emerge). This chimes with
evidence that involuntary autobiographical memories are more likely to be
elicited during low-demanding tasks inducing a diffused state of attention
(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R130" ref-type="bibr">Schlagman &amp; Kvavilashvili, 2008</xref>)
than during high-demanding tasks (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Ball,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Barzykowski &amp;
Niedźwieńska, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R159" ref-type="bibr">Vannucci et al., 2015</xref>). One could also argue that the priming task
in Experiment 1 and the voluntary-memory tasks in Experiments 1 and 2 entailed
higher retrieval-load than the everyday tasks during which intrusions occurred
according to the diary (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P89">To test the retrieval load hypothesis in Experiment 3, we manipulated
load levels during the vigilance-intrusion task (that was validated in
Experiment 2) by using concurrent WM tasks. Participants performed three times a
novel version of the vigilance-intrusion task, each time with a different
(within-group) load condition: no load, visuospatial load (additional
visuospatial WM task), and verbal load (additional verbal WM task). The contrast
between verbal and visuospatial WM tasks allowed us to test whether a potential
lack of (or smaller) interference effect in retrieval conditions with high load
depends on the load’s modality. We expected that an additional
visuospatial WM load would leave less room for intrusive memories, given claims
that visuospatial WM shares modality-specific resources (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Andrade, Kavanagh, &amp; Baddeley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley &amp; Andrade, 2000</xref>) and
neurocircuitry (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Albers, Kok, Toni, Dijkerman,
&amp; de Lange, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R118" ref-type="bibr">Pearson,
Naselaris, Holmes, &amp; Kosslyn, 2015</xref>) with visual imagery, which
appears to underlie many intrusive memories in clinical populations (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Grey &amp; Holmes, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Hackmann, Ehlers, Speckens, &amp; Clark, 2004</xref>; Holmes, Grey,
&amp; Young, 2005). However, it is also possible that any (even verbal) WM
load (e.g., by taxing general-domain central executive functions) reduces the
opportunity for intrusions (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Engelhard et al.,
2010</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Gunter &amp; Bodner,
2008</xref>; <xref rid="R157" ref-type="bibr">van den Hout &amp;
Engelhard, 2012</xref>), thereby reducing the sensitivity to an interference
effect.</p>
                <p id="P90">Note that unlike in Experiments 1 and 2 where the nature of intrusive
memories was inferred indirectly (i.e., by comparing intrusion tasks with other
memory tasks that did not involve intrusion monitoring), here we tested the
effect of concurrent load levels (and their interaction with the interference
effect) <italic>directly</italic> on intrusions rates.</p>
                <p id="P91">In addition to addressing potential contributions of retrieval factors
to the selectivity of the interference effect, it is also important to establish
which aspects of the interference procedure are required to produce the
interference effect itself. This is an important methodological issue for future
research wishing to investigate/replicate this selective interference effect,
and for translational applications (e.g., whether it is necessary to remind a
victim of their recent trauma before intervening with an interference task).
Thus, we also sought to establish whether <italic>both</italic> components of
our interference procedure (film reminder cues and Tetris game-play) are needed
to produce the interference effect. As already alluded in the General
Introduction, our previous studies (including current Experiments 1 and 2) have
all used reminder cues when an interference task was performed 30 min after the
film (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2012</xref>; Holmes et
al., 2009; Holmes, James, et al., 2010)—with the rationale that the cues
help orient attention to the target event (<xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2018</xref>)—but the necessity of such reminder cues
in this timeframe remain untested (unlike evidence that such cues are indeed
needed 24 h after the film; Experiment 2 in <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>). We tested the requirement for a reminder cue by
adding a third group of participants who played Tetris without such cue
(<italic>Tetris-only</italic> group).</p>
                <sec id="S53">
                  <title>Hypotheses</title>
                  <p id="P92">First, we predicted a replication of the key finding from Experiment
2 showing that the reminder-plus-Tetris group experience fewer laboratory
intrusions relative to the reminder-only group, using the same
vigilance-intrusion task with <italic>key presses</italic>. A novel
hypothesis concerned the effects of retrieval load on intrusions in the
vigilance-intrusion task, using a modified version where participants
retrospectively reported the number of intrusions they
experienced—henceforth the vigilance-intrusion task with
<italic>estimates</italic> (see Methods for rationale). We hypothesized
that the interference effect would be modulated by (interact with) retrieval
load, such that the reminder-plus-Tetris group would have fewer intrusive
memories than the reminder-only group when there is low retrieval-load
during intrusion retrieval, but this interference would be absent (or at
least smaller) when there is high retrieval-load instead (especially if that
load involves visuospatial WM). Finally, if the interference effect on
intrusions is conditional upon a reminder cue prior to the interference
task, then the reminder-plus-Tetris group would show fewer intrusions
memories than both the reminder-only group and the new Tetris-only
group.</p>

                      <p id="P97">Additional vigilance-intrusion tasks were administered with
further modifications to test the retrieval load hypothesis (Stage
II; see the Procedure section). Critically, there was no longer the
need to press the Intrusion key when participants experienced an
intrusion. Instead, intrusions were assessed using retrospective
estimates (<xref rid="R129" ref-type="bibr">Schaich, Watkins,
&amp; Ehring, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R169" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche, Ehring, &amp; Ehlers, 2009</xref>). The original
design (270 trials) was divided into three consecutive runs (three
3-min runs with 90 trials each). As background scenes, each run
presented each of the 11 film stills once, alongside 19 foil stills
(different from those presented in the vigilance-intrusion task with
key presses). After each run, the task paused so that participants
could estimate how many intrusions they had for that run
(<italic>how often did memories of the event in the form of
mental images pop into your mind in the last three
minutes?</italic>) by typing in the corresponding count using
the number keypad on the keyboard (see the online supplemental
materials for further details). We reasoned that retrospective
recall bias would be minimized compared with giving a single rating
for a full 9-min period. The total number of intrusions per
condition was summed across the three consecutive 3-min runs.</p>
                      <p id="P98">The use of estimates after 3-min runs, and removing the need
for key presses to report intrusions on the fly, meant that
participants could more readily perform the vigilance-intrusion task
and a WM task simultaneously, allowing for our intended manipulation
of retrieval load. Otherwise, they would have had to perform three
tasks simultaneously (vigilance, WM task and intrusion reporting
with key presses). Importantly, participants performed the
digit-vigilance task using their nondominant hand (and the Mouse
rather than the keyboard), freeing up their dominant hands required
for one of the WM tasks described below.</p>

task was used as the additional visuospatial WM load (Baddeley,

was labeled with an individual letter from A to Y, running from left

vigilance-intrusion task to use retrospective to estimate intrusion
rates, and also practiced the WM memory tasks. For finger tapping,
participants overpracticed this task by tapping the sequence for 5 min
without interruption, with the tapping box out of sight and without
visual feedback (similar to Holmes et al., 2004). For counting,
participants were asked to count backward for 5 min without
feedback.</p>
                    <p id="P103">In the experimental phase, participants completed the
vigilance-intrusion task (with <italic>estimates</italic>) under all
three conditions of WM loads in an counterbalanced order (controlling
for both effects of load order and time). For each load condition, three
consecutive 3-min runs were completed. For no load, the
vigilance-intrusion task was performed as it is. For visuospatial load,
participants began each run of the vigilance-intrusion task with a
reminder to tap the visuospatial pattern, and were asked to stop tapping
at the end of a run. Tapping responses were recorded by the computer
program. For the verbal load, participants began each run of the
vigilance-intrusion task with predesignated number seeds (958, 845, and
969, respectively, as in <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et
al., 2012</xref>) alongside a reminder to start counting out loud,
and were asked to stop counting at the end of a run. Their verbal
responses were tape-recorded. Finally, participants were debriefed and
reimbursed.</p>

                    <p id="P112">Experiment 3 again replicated the interference effect on
intrusions in a vigilance-intrusion task (with key presses), even when
intrusions were reported at fixed task-duration (a previous confound in
Experiment 2). Critically, the degree of interference did not vary
significantly according to whether participants were engaged in a
concurrent verbal or visuospatial WM load during a new version of the
vigilance-intrusion task (with estimates). These results therefore fail
to support the hypothesis that interference on intrusions is absent (or
smaller) when participants are taxed by high retrieval-load. We
hypothesized that (visuospatial/verbal) retrieval load during the
vigilance-intrusion task would compete with the resources needed for
intrusions to occur, leaving less room for an interference effect.
Although manipulations of both visuospatial and verbal load (compared
with no load) at intrusion retrieval did reduce intrusion rates overall,
neither of these retrieval load effects interacted with group, and
interference was detected in all three load-conditions. In other words,
retrieval load appears detrimental to intrusions, consistent with
research on in voluntary memories (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Ball,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Barzykowski &amp;
Niedźwieńska, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R130" ref-type="bibr">Schlagman &amp; Kvavilashvili, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R159" ref-type="bibr">Vannucci et al., 2015</xref>), but such
effects appear to be additional and independent from the effects exerted
at the time of intervention by the interference task (Tetris after
reminder cues). This finding that yet another obvious retrieval
factor—here retrieval load—does not appear to explain the
interference effects on (intrusive) memory is difficult to reconcile
with single-trace accounts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure
1</xref>). We return to the broader theoretical implications in the
General Discussion.</p>
                    <p id="P113">The equivalent reduction in intrusive memories by a concurrent
visuospatial versus verbal load is consistent with a general-load effect
(<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Engelhard et al., 2010</xref>;

Holmes, James, et al., 2010; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et

(intrusive) memory as experienced <italic>during</italic> a WM-load
manipulation (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Engelhard et al.,

research supporting a modality-specific account mostly concern
(intrusive) memory as experienced <italic>after</italic> a WM-load
manipulations (for a review, see <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">James,
Lau-Zhu, Clark, et al., 2016</xref>). Future research could
systematically manipulate modality and load levels, while also assessing
intrusions both during and following WM loads, to delineate the impact
and time course of modality-specific versus general-load effects (also
see the online supplemental materials).</p>
                    <p id="P114">Intrusion rates were reduced only when Tetris was preceded by a
reminder cue (i.e., not by Tetris alone), here 30 min after the film. As
we have reasoned previously, many other types of information can enter
WM during a 30-min period after an experience; an orientation cue might
be important in allowing the target memory to be brought into attention
sufficiently for interference to be exerted (<xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2018</xref>). For this reason, we have
also used a cue before gameplay in the first hours after real trauma
while patients are waiting in hospital in a different context to the one
in which the trauma occurred, namely accidents on the road (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai, Blackwell, et al., 2018</xref>).
Hence, the reminder cue appears to be a procedural requirement to bring
about the selective interference effect in future studies.</p>
                    <p id="P115">Critically, the third group in Experiment 3 provided additional
theoretical leverage. One could have argued that reminder cues in the
initial control group (reminder-only group in Experiments 1–3)
led to retrieval practice during the 10-min silence period, which then
<italic>increased</italic> intrusions above the reminder-plus-Tetris
group, rather than the latter group showing <italic>reduced</italic>
intrusions per se. The inclusion of the Tetris-only group here served as
an additional active control-group, ruling out a potential
reminder-boosting effect. Specifically, the Tetris-only group showed
number of intrusions comparable with the reminder-only group, suggesting
that the reminder cues in themselves in the reminder-only group were
unlikely to have increased intrusion. Hence, the additional Tetris-only
group is not only relevant for replications/translations, but also
strengths our interpretation from Experiments 1 and 2 that the
interference task <italic>reduces</italic> intrusive memories.</p>
                    <p id="P116">Experiment 3 did not directly compare intrusive versus
voluntary memory. The finding that load during memory assessments fail
to moderate the interference effect suggests that retrieval load is
unlikely to have been a critical confound in previous demonstrations of
the intrusive/voluntary memory dissociation (including those in
Experiments 1 and 2). However, high load in recognition tasks is only
assumed. Future replications could compare both intrusive and voluntary
memories while directly manipulating (and measuring) retrieval load
within both memory conditions.</p>

reminder cues followed by Tetris game-play)—delivered after encoding
of a film with traumatic content—on intrusive (involuntary) versus
voluntary memory of the film. Although trauma film research over the last
two decades has revealed that interference tasks can affect intrusive but
not voluntary memory, this has never been shown while systematically
controlling for key methodological differences between the two types of
memory retrieval, as we did here using a battery of novel memory measures
(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We first summarize our
key findings, and then discuss their theoretical implications for the
controversial debate concerning the relationship between involuntary
(intrusive) and voluntary memory (also see the Introduction). We argue that
our findings challenge single-trace memory theories, and further constrain
separate-trace memory theories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure

possible future directions.</p>

number of intrusive memories in a 1-week diary (Experiments 1 and 2;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), but did not impact
performance on well-matched measures of voluntary retrieval, namely free
recall (Experiment 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and
recognition (Experiments 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
4</xref>) at one week. Moreover, neither did the interference task
impact other measures of involuntary retrieval, namely perceptual
priming by film cues (Experiment 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
4</xref>), nor attentional capture by film cues (Experiment 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P119">However, we were able to extend the interference effect on
intrusions recorded in a diary to intrusions reported in a laboratory
assessment (the vigilance-intrusion task). Different intrusion
assessments furnished different rates of intrusions. From highest to
lowest intrusion rates, intrusions were assessed by vigilance-task on
Day 1 using key presses (Experiment 3); with retrospective estimations
(Experiment 3); additional validating reports (Experiment 2);
vigilance-task on Day 8 (Experiment 2); and finally diary intrusions
(Experiments 1 and 2). Vigilance-intrusions tasks not only produced
higher intrusion rates, but also within a shorter timeframe and within
the same laboratory context and time point as the other measures of
memory, providing further match to those measures. Yet, all intrusion
reporting-methods were sufficiently sensitive to reveal interference.
Interference effects on laboratory intrusions were observed on Day 8
(Experiment 2), soon after interference on Day 1 (Experiments 2 and 3;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), and irrespective of
the degree and type of WM load at retrieval (Experiment 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P120">We can also more confidently interpret our overall findings as
the interference task (reminder-plus-Tetris) <italic>reducing</italic>
intrusions, as opposed to the reminder cues in the control group
(reminder-only) <italic>increasing</italic> intrusions; otherwise, the
latter would have boosted intrusions against an additional active
control group without such cues (Tetris-only), but that was not the case
(Experiment 3).</p>
                    <p id="P121">Taken together, our new battery of memory measures suggests
that the apparent dissociation between intrusive and voluntary memory is
not accounted for by the most obvious retrieval factors, as informed by
foundational textbook theories of memory (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley et al., 2009</xref>) and key accounts of involuntary
memory (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>), namely
cue overlap (Experiment 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
4</xref>), attentional capture (Experiment 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), and retrieval load (Experiment 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, neither were
our findings explained by group differences in baseline measures,
measures for film viewing, task compliance nor expectations (see the
online supplemental materials). This would seem difficult to reconcile
with single-trace theories, and more compatible with separate-trace
theories in which intrusions arise from a memory system separate to that
underlying (voluntary) episodic memory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Our data therefore extend a considerable
number of previous claims that interference tasks impact intrusions
while sparing voluntary expressions of the memory (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Bourne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; Brewin &amp; Saunders, 2001; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Krans et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

                    <p id="P122">Single-trace theories broadly propose a single system
underlying episodic memory (<xref rid="R142" ref-type="bibr">Squire

trace is accessed for involuntary and voluntary conscious retrieval of
episodes. Therefore, any differential effects of the interference task
on intrusions versus voluntary memory are likely to arise at the time of
retrieval—because of methodological differences between the
various memory tasks—rather than genuine differences in the
underlying memory trace. If so, by matching or controlling for such
retrieval factors, we should cease to observe the selective interference
effect, that is, no longer see a differential impact on involuntary
versus voluntary retrieval (Experiments 1 and 2), or at least be able to
modulate the size of the interference effect on intrusions (Experiment
3). However, when we manipulated the three obvious retrieval factors
(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), as informed by core
textbook memory principles (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley et
al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen,
2009</xref>), we found that interference remained selective to
intrusive memories, and regardless of retrieval context. It is possible
that there is yet another retrieval factor that is critical and that we
did not explore, but until then, the present data seem difficult to
reconcile with single-trace accounts in which interference disrupts the
same trace involved in intrusions and voluntary retrieval.</p>
                    <p id="P123">Our data are more consistent with separate-trace accounts of
memory that permit distinct traces for intrusive and voluntary memory

There are various accounts of this type in the clinical literature (for
a review see <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Dalgleish, 2004</xref>),
but the most prominent one is dual representation accounts (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Bisby &amp; Burgess, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Brewin et al., 1996, 2010</xref>). Such accounts suggest
that intrusive reexperiencing and voluntary retrieval of trauma are
governed by distinct memory systems, with intrusions supported by a
specialized long-term perceptual memory system that is functionally
dissociable from the episodic memory system supporting voluntary recall
of the same event (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>).
The former system is thought to be preferentially susceptible to our
sensory-perceptual/visuospatial (Tetris) interference task (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Brewin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>), consistent with our
findings.</p>
                    <p id="P124">Our result that the interference effect on intrusions did not
appear to arise from changes in perceptual priming appears at odds with
clinical accounts of intrusive symptom development in PTSD (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Holz et al., 2014</xref>; Michael &amp; Ehlers, 2007;
<xref rid="R146" ref-type="bibr">Sündermann et al.,
2013</xref>), although intrusions and priming could still be linked
through other means. Our intrusion/priming dissociation is more
compatible with the widely accepted distinction between nondeclarative
(supporting priming) and declarative memory systems (supporting
intrusions; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>). In
other words, what seems to distinguish intrusive memories is the
<italic>conscious</italic> involuntary retrieval, unlike implicit
priming which is thought to involve <italic>unconscious</italic>
involuntary retrieval; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen,
1996</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P125">Consolidation is assumed to be a slow and time-dependent memory
process, hence influences on it may become apparent only after a delay
(e.g., after hours/days or after sleep) but not necessarily sooner
(<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Dudai, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">McGaugh, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">Nader, 2003</xref>). Our interference effects on
intrusions were almost immediate, casting doubt on whether such effects
arise from changes in consolidation as previously assumed (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Deeprose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, et al., 2010</xref>). It is
also possible that effects on early intrusions (e.g., attributable to
temporary interference) differ from those on later intrusions (e.g.,
attributable to consolidation). Nevertheless, such assumptions on the
time course of (emotional) memory consolidation currently rely on rodent
studies and using paradigms that tap into nondeclarative memory,
including fear conditioning and instrumental learning (<xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">McGaugh, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R107" ref-type="bibr">Miserendino, Sananes, Melia, &amp;
Davis, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">Nader,
2003</xref>; <xref rid="R128" ref-type="bibr">Schafe &amp;
LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al.,
2018</xref>). In contrast, the same assumptions are not fully
endorsed in human studies using paradigms that tap into declarative
memory (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Dewar, Cowan, &amp; Sala,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="R166" ref-type="bibr">Wixted, 2004</xref>),
which we assume support conscious aspects of intrusions. It therefore
currently remains unclear when consolidation begins or ends for human
declarative memories, leaving open the possibility that our effects are
still related to consolidation.</p>

                    <title>Methodological Considerations</title>
                    <p id="P126">One consideration is whether procedures used with the trauma
film paradigm (<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">James, Lau-Zhu, Clark, et
al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al.,
2018</xref>) extend to real-life trauma and clinical populations.
Indeed, our interference procedure (initially developed in the
laboratory) has recently been shown to reduce intrusive memories after
real-life trauma (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Horsch et al.,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai, Blackwell, et
al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al.,
2018</xref>) albeit in early and proof-of-concept stage findings
warranting further enquiry. Diagnostic criteria for PTSD now allow
indirect exposure to trauma via film footage to fulfill criteria for
trauma exposure (so long as it is work-related), for instance,
journalists who perform news editing (APA, 2013). There is also
increased recognition that exposure to traumatic events via electronic
mediums (e.g., film footage) can also result in stress-related symptoms
that warrant further scrutiny (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Holman,
Garfin, &amp; Silver, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R134" ref-type="bibr">Silver et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P127">Another potential criticism relates to the use of a diary to
record intrusive memories in daily life, where the conditions that
elicit intrusions (e.g., retrieval cues) are difficult to control for.
However, our findings on intrusions converged across assessments, both
in the diary and in the laboratory (with presumably higher level of
experimental control). One may also argue that self-report such as for
reporting intrusions is subjected to demand characteristics, yet our
findings suggest that groups were matched on expectations about the
direction of the interference effects (see the online supplemental
materials), and demand ratings are typically ruled out as a confound in
trauma film studies (<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">James, Lau-Zhu,
Clark, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu
et al., 2018</xref>). Future research should continue to leverage
laboratory assessments of intrusions informed by a modeling of factors
that govern everyday intrusions (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu
et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R149" ref-type="bibr">Takarangi et
al., 2014</xref>), as well as assess other concomitant affective
outcomes such as physiological correlates (<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Kunze, Arntz, &amp; Kindt, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R163" ref-type="bibr">Wegerer, Blechert, Kerschbaum, &amp;
Wilhelm, 2013</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P128">The absence of interference on some of the memory tasks (i.e.,
those not assessing intrusions) could reflect lack of statistical power
(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, Kelley, &amp; Maxwell,
2017</xref>), as we mainly powered our study on the basis of effect
sizes for intrusion effects. Nevertheless, the interference effects in
free recall and priming (Experiment 1) and in attentional bias
(Experiment 2) were numerically in the opposite direction to that in
intrusions, and thus it does not appear to be the case that a trend just
failed to reach significance because of low power. This interpretation
was further corroborated by additional ANOVAs on standardized
scores—which demonstrated the effect sizes for intrusions were
significantly bigger than in the other measures (this interaction would
be unlikely to be significant if the other measures were just extremely
noisy)—as well as additional analyses using an Bayesian approach
supporting the relevant lack of group differences (see the online
supplemental materials).</p>
                    <p id="P129">Further converging evidence with our current memory
dissociation findings could be sought in at least three ways. First,
more stringent between-groups designs could be used—where each
participant is given only a single retrieval task—to fully rule
out contamination effects across memory tasks that could potentially
arise from the fixed-order designs used in our three experiments.
Second, additional task comparisons could account for other differences
between measures of intrusive/involuntary and voluntary memories not
directly addressed here, such as the use of frequency versus accuracy as
main outcomes. Although there was a strong correspondence between
frequency count and accuracy within the diary (proportions of reported
intrusions matched with film scenes were 87% to 98%), additional
evidence they are assessing a similar construct should be explored.
Other retrieval factors to account for include the requirement for
monitoring (<xref rid="R158" ref-type="bibr">Vannucci et al.,
2014</xref>), the ease of retrieval (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Barzykowski &amp; Staugaard, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R154" ref-type="bibr">Uzer, Lee, &amp; Brown, 2012</xref>), and types of
triggers (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Mace, 2004</xref>; Staugaard &amp;
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2014</xref>). Third, there
remains the possibility that each measure may not be pure, mixing
involuntary and voluntary contributions (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Hellawell &amp; Brewin, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Mace, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Richardson-Klavehn &amp; Bjork, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="R164" ref-type="bibr">Whalley et al., 2013</xref>). Alternative
approaches can be considered to dissociate controlled from automatic
contributions within a given task (<xref rid="R168" ref-type="bibr">Yonelinas &amp; Jacoby, 2012</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P130">Our selective interference effects remain to be demonstrated
with other memory paradigms. Although the impact of postencoding
interference on subsequent memory has been demonstrated using a variety
of episodic materials (other than trauma films), such studies tend to
use nonemotional stimuli (e.g., objects; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Hupbach, Gomez, Hardt, &amp; Nadel, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Hupbach, Gomez, &amp; Nadel,

consider other forms of clinically relevant outcomes, such as ratings of
vividness/emotionality (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Engelhard et
al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Leer et al.,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="R148" ref-type="bibr">Tadmor, McNally,
&amp; Engelhard, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R156" ref-type="bibr">van den Hout et al., 2014</xref>). Some of these have also found
that reductions in vividness/emotionality (of nonaversive stimuli) were
accompanied by worsening of recognition performance (<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Leer et al., 2017</xref>; van den Hout,
Bartelski, &amp; Engelhard, 2013), suggesting that not all
interference effects are selective, unlike in our experiments.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to draw direct comparisons, as
<italic>involuntary</italic> retrieval (a key feature of intrusive
memory) is not directly addressed in such studies. It would be of great
interest for future research to combine these various lines of
investigation of the effects of postencoding interference on different
stimuli/measures.</p>

                <title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title>
                <p id="P131">Our results of a selective interference effect on intrusive memories
highlight the need for theories of episodic memory to accommodate findings on
intrusive/involuntary forms of memories, and to extend clinical theories such as
dual representation accounts. They may also inform clinical interventions
seeking to selectively target intrusive memories without erasing voluntary
memories of emotional events. Future research should further dissect mechanisms
underlying the effects discussed. These include the timing of the intervention
in relation to film viewing (<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">James, Lau-Zhu,
Tickle, et al., 2016</xref>), the specificity as well as timing of delivery
of the reminder cue (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Horsch et al., 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai, Blackwell, et al., 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>), the nature of
the event (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Arnaudova &amp; Hagenaars,

<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>), and aspects
related to the interference task, to resolve controversies around issues of task
modality (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Hagenaars et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) and individual task
performance (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Another important
issue that merits further investigation is how intrusive memories are
experienced once they emerge (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Lau-Zhu et al.,
2018</xref>; <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">Marks, Franklin, &amp;

functioning (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai, Visser, et al.,

constrain theories on intrusive memories and their relationship to voluntary
memory of emotional events, and help optimize translational parameters.</p>

                <title>Context Paragraph</title>
                <p id="P132">This series of experiments tackled one of the most heated debates in
the literature on intrusive memories (single vs. separate-trace accounts). We
began a research program involving clinical and basic memory researchers to help
resolve this long-standing controversy in the trauma-film literature spanning
the last two decades. This collaboration showcases the benefits of taking an
experimental approach to study psychopathology, in terms of advancing cognitive
theories, and in doing so, promoting clinical innovations. The interference
procedure used has already shown initial early stage promise to prevent
intrusive memories of real-life traumas (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Horsch
et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Iyadurai, Blackwell, et
al., 2018</xref>). Experimental studies can further illuminate the
theoretical basis of such therapeutic gains to refine translational parameters.
An exciting opportunity is to extend novel applications for clinical areas
beyond trauma where intrusive imagery is increasingly recognized as a promising
intervention target. These areas include hypomania (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2012</xref>), affect lability (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Di Simplicio et al., 2016</xref>), visceral

(<xref rid="R135" ref-type="bibr">Skorka-Brown, Andrade, Whalley, &amp;

presented with still-halves and were asked to judge whether or not both halves
matched—that is, whether both halves belonged to the same original still.
The still-halves were initially covered by salt-and-pepper noise (black and
white pixels superimposed on the still), and became progressively clearer over 6
sec, as 20% of the noise pixels were removed every 1250 msec. The fully revealed
still-halves remained on screen for up to 2 sec further. Participants could make
a response at any point in these 8 sec (either with some noise or fully clear),
with the trial terminating upon a response. This figure is for illustration and
thus not to scale. Stimuli in the actual experiment were in color (not
black-and-white).</p>

centrally presented. Participants were instructed to press the GO key every time
they saw a digit that was not ‘3,’ and to press the Intrusion key
whenever they experienced an intrusive memory of the film. This task is also
used in Experiment 3 albeit with slight modifications. A sample trial of the
attentional-capture task is presented in panel B. Participants were presented
with a film-foil still pair, which quickly disappeared and was followed by a dot
probe behind the original location of either still. Participants were instructed
to judge the identity of the dot probe (i.e., one or two dots) as accurately and
as quickly as possible. Pictures are for illustration only and thus not to
