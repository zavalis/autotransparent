                <title>Significance</title>
                <p>An established theoretical model, predictive coding, states that the brain is constantly building models (signifying changing predictions) of the environment. The brain does this by forming predictions and signaling sensory inputs which deviate from predictions (“prediction errors”). Various hypotheses exist about how predictive coding could be implemented in the brain. We recorded neural spiking and oscillations with laminar resolution in a network of cortical areas as monkeys performed a working memory task with changing stimulus predictability. Predictability modulated the patterns of feedforward/feedback flow, cortical layers, and oscillations used to process a visual stimulus. These data support the theory of predictive coding but suggest an alternate model for its neural implementation: predictive routing.</p>

              <abstract>
                <p>In predictive coding, experience generates predictions that attenuate the feeding forward of predicted stimuli while passing forward unpredicted “errors.” Different models have suggested distinct cortical layers, and rhythms implement predictive coding. We recorded spikes and local field potentials from laminar electrodes in five cortical areas (visual area 4 [V4], lateral intraparietal [LIP], posterior parietal area 7A, frontal eye field [FEF], and prefrontal cortex [PFC]) while monkeys performed a task that modulated visual stimulus predictability. During predictable blocks, there was enhanced alpha (8 to 14 Hz) or beta (15 to 30 Hz) power in all areas during stimulus processing and prestimulus beta (15 to 30 Hz) functional connectivity in deep layers of PFC to the other areas. Unpredictable stimuli were associated with increases in spiking and in gamma-band (40 to 90 Hz) power/connectivity that fed forward up the cortical hierarchy via superficial-layer cortex. Power and spiking modulation by predictability was stimulus specific. Alpha/beta power in LIP, FEF, and PFC inhibited spiking in deep layers of V4. Area 7A uniquely showed increases in high-beta (∼22 to 28 Hz) power/connectivity to unpredictable stimuli. These results motivate a conceptual model, predictive routing. It suggests that predictive coding may be implemented via lower-frequency alpha/beta rhythms that “prepare” pathways processing-predicted inputs by inhibiting feedforward gamma rhythms and associated spiking.</p>

            <p content-type="flushleft">The brain exploits predictability. It makes cortical processing more efficient. Visuomotor integration, visual/auditory speech perception, and visual perception all benefit when sensory inputs are predictable (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The brain has an arsenal of mechanisms to tamp down and improve processing of familiar, repeated, or predictable inputs. One example is stimulus-specific adaptation. All over cortex, there is less spiking and smaller blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses when a stimulus is repeated (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Responsiveness is recovered if the stimulus is changed or a pattern is violated (i.e., to “oddballs”) (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This can lead to fewer activated neurons but finer-tuned, more robust representations (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
            <p>But the brain does more than adapt to repeated inputs. A wide variety of evidence indicates that it makes mental models of the world that actively generate predictions, a process known as predictive coding (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Moment-to-moment predictions are used to inhibit processing of expected inputs which, because they were expected, are not informative. Unexpected sensory inputs that deviate from a prediction, are “prediction errors” (PEs). They are informative and thus not inhibited, fed forward, processed, affect behavior, and are used to update the prediction models.</p>
            <p>Much of the work on the neural mechanisms of prediction and its violation has focused on spiking activity (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). But there is mounting evidence that oscillatory dynamics play a role in regulating cortical processing and thus can also play a role, especially the gamma (40 to 90 Hz) and alpha/beta (10 to 30 Hz) bands (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A key observation is that, all across cortex, gamma power (&gt;35 Hz)/spiking is higher during bottom-up sensory inputs. They are anticorrelated with alpha/beta (8 to 30 Hz) power (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), which is higher under conditions of top-down control (e.g., attention and response inhibition) (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This suggests that top-down alpha/beta help regulate the processing of bottom-up inputs served by gamma and spiking. The idea is that alpha/beta carries the top-down predictions that inhibit the gamma/spiking that process expected inputs. This is consistent with gamma power being higher in the superficial, feedforward, cortical layers, and alpha/beta power being higher in the deep, feedback, cortical layers (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Indeed, superficial cortical layers have been hypothesized to be specialized for computing PEs and feeding PEs forward at gamma frequency (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, computational modeling studies have shown the plausibility of superficial gamma circuits to engage in prediction error computations (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Direct evidence for alpha/beta and gamma in predictive coding per se comes from observations of increased gamma power to stimuli that are prediction errors (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
            <p>How these rhythms (and their relation to spiking) differ with stimulus repetition/predictability as well as their stimulus specificity is not well known. Most neurophysiological studies of the effects of stimulus predictability have focused on spiking activity, often in a single area. And none of them to date have examined and compared activity in different cortical layers. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking using multiarea, multilaminar recordings from a visual area (V4) and higher-order cortical areas (posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex [PFC]) simultaneously. Area V4 was selected as previous studies have shown this area to be a target of top-down signals such as attention (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Frontoparietal cortex was targeted because of its well-established role in top-down attention and working memory, cognitive processes that are engaged in the task employed here (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We manipulated the predictability of objects used in a working memory task. This revealed layer and frequency-specific associations with stimulus repetition/predictability as well as evidence for the direction of flow of these signals. The findings suggest an update of neural models of prediction and predictive coding.</p>

In the gamma band, responses to predictable samples gradually reduced, reaching their minimum response at different trials in different areas. This followed a hierarchical progression with V4 reaching its minimum earliest at trial 19 (reflecting 18 repetitions), LIP at trial 35, 7A at trial 46, and both FEF and PFC at trial 49 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2014868117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). In the alpha and beta bands, sample repetition caused power to increase. This plateaued after a number of repetitions. There was no clear hierarchical progression, with different areas reaching their maximum alpha/beta power in a wide variety of repetitions (range in areas LIP, 7A, FEF, and PFC: trials 12 to 47, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2014868117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7<italic>B</italic></ext-link>).

                <title>Stimulus Specificity of Spiking and LFP Power Modulation.</title>
                <p>We next investigated whether the effects of predictability were stimulus specific. We tested whether the modulation of LFP power was strongest at recording sites that preferred (showed higher spiking to) the specific stimulus that is being predicted. We addressed this in V4 because its spiking showed the strongest spiking selectivity for the identity of the sample objects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2014868117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).</p>
                <p>We first analyzed each V4 site’s MUA activity for sample object specificity. For each V4 site, the sample that produced the highest MUA activity was defined as the “preferred” sample. The sample object that produced the least MUA activity was the “nonpreferred” sample. We calculated differences in power during unpredictable vs. predictable blocks for the preferred and nonpreferred samples separately.</p>
                <p>Power modulation was stimulus specific. It was higher for the recording site’s preferred than nonpreferred sample object. During the sample interval, LFP gamma power and MUA modulation (unpredictable &gt; predictable) was greater to the preferred sample in superficial cortical layers (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing each site’s preferred vs. nonpreferred power modulation) but not in deep layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref> for LFP gamma and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic></xref> for MUA).

                <title>Network Interactions for Predictability.</title>
                <p>We first examined network interactions using coherence analysis between LFPs recorded in each pair of areas. During the sample interval, this confirmed coherence networks involving theta and gamma for unpredictable samples and alpha and beta for predictable samples (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2014868117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <italic>Supplemental Results</italic> and Figs.

                <p>The strength and sign of modulation of GC by predictability depended on frequency and directionality. In the feedforward direction, unpredictable &gt; predictable GC modulation peaked in the gamma-frequency range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, solid red lines). Although the feedback direction was also positively modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, dotted red lines), the percentage of modulated connections was lower than feedforward gamma (χ<sup>2</sup> test for percentage of positive modulation across the gamma band, 40 to 90 Hz, in the feedforward vs. feedback directions, 0.57 vs. 0.33, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-13). In the theta band (2–6 Hz), an approximately equal percentage of both feedforward and feedback connections had positive task modulation (unpredicted &gt; predicted GC).</p>
                <p>Notably, virtually all directed functional connections with greater GC during predictable than unpredictable samples were in the alpha and beta bands (blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). And they were mostly feedback connections. The percentage of feedback direction GC that was greater for predictable than unpredictable samples was higher than those in feedforward direction for alpha (χ<sup>2</sup> test for percentage of negative modulation across the alpha band, 8 to 14 Hz, in the feedforward vs. feedback directions, 0% vs. 29%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-5), beta (χ<sup>2</sup> test for percentage of negative modulation across the beta band, 15 to 30 Hz, in the feedforward vs. feedback directions, 10% vs. 30%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-5), and theta (χ<sup>2</sup> test for percentage of negative modulation across the theta band, 2 to 6 Hz, in the feedforward vs. feedback directions, 0% vs. 10%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). There was no predictable &gt; unpredictable GC modulation in the gamma band in either direction. In short, feedforward functional connections were enhanced during unpredictable samples, especially in the gamma range, whereas feedback functional connections were enhanced during predictable samples with a peak at alpha/beta frequencies.</p>
                <p>To determine the layer specificity of these effects, we focused on the two areas at the bottom and top of the hierarchy: V4 and PFC. The rationale was that GC interactions from V4 to the other areas are all feedforward, and interactions from PFC to the other areas are all feedback. The modulation of these feedforward and feedback functional connections by layer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref> (for V4) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref> (for PFC) during the sample interval, and for PFC during the presample interval in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>F</italic></xref>.</p>
                <p>During the sample interval, feedforward connections from V4 to the rest of the areas were greater during unpredictable samples. This modulation was greater in superficial layers than deep layers in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>, Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing modulations for all feedforward channel pairs in superficial vs. deep layers, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-3 for theta, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-14 for alpha, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-8 for beta, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-3 for gamma). By contrast, in PFC feedback, GC was greater during predictable samples, especially in the beta band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>). This effect was stronger in superficial than deep layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>, Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing task modulations for all feedback channel pairs in superficial vs. deep, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-16 for the beta band, not significant for the alpha band).

                <p>During the presample interval, PFC feedback was different depending on whether it arose from superficial vs. deep layers. Superficial-layer PFC feedback was greater during unpredictable blocks but deep-layer PFC feedback was greater during predictable blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>F</italic></xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p content-type="flushleft">Our results show differences in oscillatory dynamics between cortical layers as animals switch between two different modes of processing. In the “bottom-up” mode, a new sensory input had to be processed on every trial. In the other, “top-down” mode the same stimulus was used on every trial and thus there was no need to fully process new bottom-up inputs. In bottom-up mode, gamma power and feedforward Granger causality predominated. By contrast, in top-down mode, alpha/beta power and feedback Granger causality predominated.</p>
              <p>This could be due to a variety of processes that differ between the two modes. One is habituation/adaptation due to stimulus repetition. To examine this, we measured effects as a function of the time between repetitions of the same sample object. This revealed that short-term adaptation alone did not explain the results. Longer-term stimulus repetition could have contributed. Passive adaptation effects tend to reach their maximum after just a single repetition (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In our study repetition effects took dozens of trials to reach their maximum and correlated with the behavioral time course of improvement. This suggests that the animals were exploiting the increasing familiarity due to repetition. This is not surprising. Repetition is a foundation of predictability. Most, if not all, forms of prediction likely depend on repetition whether the repetition was from past experience or generated in the recent past (seconds to minutes).</p>
              <p>In addition, the neurophysiological signatures of prediction and passive stimulus repetition are divergent. In previous studies where stimulus repetition was not behaviorally relevant, gamma-band power and synchronization in visual cortex increased with repetition, whereas we observed decreases (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In our study, repetition was used by the animals to perform the task. Here, we have used repetition as an initial tool to elicit predictions and top-down processing. In future paradigms, we will test more cognitive forms of prediction, such as learned associations.</p>
              <p>In bottom-up mode, new inputs needed to be fully attended, processed, and temporarily held in working memory. In top-down mode, less attention could be paid to the repeating stimulus; it could be stored in and recalled from long-term memory. Such differences can be captured under the umbrella of predictive coding theory.</p>
              <sec id="s10">
                <title>Relation to Predictive Coding Models.</title>
                <p>Many predictive coding models share common elements. Prediction (PD) units anticipate forthcoming sensory inputs. They inhibit prediction error (PE) units when inputs match predictions. A mismatch due to an unpredictable input disinhibits the PE units. They feedforward the unpredicted input which updates the internal models that generate the predictions. Models differ on the details of the implementation in the brain. Some models (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) propose that prediction error signals act locally in each cortical area to update models. Predictions flow between areas in both feedforward and feedback directions. Other models (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) instead suggest that predictions come from higher cortical areas that act on lower cortical (sensory) areas to gate the feeding forward of prediction errors. Of special note, many current models of predictive coding emphasize that prediction errors can be modulated by precision weighting, for example, by increasing attention or sensory evidence (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Here, we have used a task that did not set out to explicitly modulate the precision of sensory samples in the unpredicted vs. predicted blocks. Sensory samples were always presented at full contrast; and in both block types, monkeys were required to attend to the samples in order to perform an attentional search. Therefore, we did not explicitly consider the issue of precision weighting of prediction errors.</p>
                <p>A distinct class of models goes further in proposing a neurophysiological implementation involving distinct oscillations. “Rhythm-based” models suggest that superficial cortical layers (layers 2 and 3) feedforward prediction errors using gamma. Deep-layer cortex (layers 5 and 6) feedback predictions using alpha/beta (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Our results are more consistent with the rhythm-based models. We showed differences between areas, with higher areas contributing more to prediction, and rhythmic- and laminar-based differences between areas. Below, we summarize and discuss these effects.</p>

                <title>The Contribution of Cortical Rhythms to Predictive Processing.</title>
                <p>Alpha/beta and gamma have properties that suggest a general role in gating and control. They are common and anticorrelated across cortex. Gamma power is high during sensory inputs; alpha/beta power is high when they are ignored. In visual cortex, gamma power is high and alpha low during sensory stimulation. When a stimulus needs to be filtered or ignored, gamma power is low and alpha is high (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">53</xref><xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Further, alpha/beta oscillations in deep cortical layers are anticorrelated with superficial-layer gamma associated with spiking carrying sensory inputs (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The balance between alpha/beta and gamma reflect the encoding, maintenance, and read-out of working memory (<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The general idea is that top-down signals are fed back through alpha/beta in deep cortical layers. They inhibit and thus gate the expression of gamma in superficial layers that help feed forward and maintain the spiking carrying sensory inputs.</p>
                <p>Extrapolating from the rhythm-based models of predictive coding (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), this suggests a framework we call predictive routing (PR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). In PR, there are not specialized circuits that compute prediction errors and send them feedforward. Rather, PR uses the same cortical circuitry used for other functions (sensory processing, attention, maintenance/control of working memory, etc.). Predictions act by alpha/beta preparation that actively inhibit the specific pathways in sensory cortex that would process the predicted input. As a result, there is less gamma and spiking to predicted inputs (and less feedforward output as a result). In other words, prediction errors do not result from a comparison between predictions and inputs via a specialized circuit. They result from the feed-forward passing of unexpected inputs because their pathways have not been prepared (functionally inhibited).</p>

The <italic>Upper</italic> boxes represent superficial layers (1 to 4) and the <italic>Lower</italic> boxes represent deep layers (5/6). (<italic>Left</italic> subpanel) Sensory cortex is dynamically prepared to process its preferred stimulus, stimulus A, by feedback which inhibits MUA and enhances alpha/beta in deep layers. Enhanced deep-layer alpha/beta functionally inhibits superficial-layer processing of stimulus A by reducing spiking and gamma, reducing feedforward outputs. (<italic>Right</italic> subpanel) When a strong prediction for stimulus B is present and stimulus A is presented (as in the first few trials of an unpredictable block after a predictable block where “B” was the repeated/predicted sample), there is less feedback alpha/beta inhibition to the A column. Deep-layer to superficial-layer inhibition is weak or absent. The A column is more excitable and responds to stimulus A with more gamma/spiking and enhanced feedforward output from superficial layers (a prediction error). Although we hypothesize this mechanism occurs at the level of cortical columns, it could apply to any pathway that processes the specific predicted stimulus. We also hypothesize that this mechanism can be graded to reflect varying strengths of prediction.</p>

                <p>This does not mean that alpha/beta (or gamma) have the exact same roles all over cortex. For example, in prefrontal cortex, beta has been modeled as an inhibitory–excitatory network but with slower time constants than what would produce a gamma (<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). By contrast, modeling suggests that in parietal cortex, there is a distinction between beta-1 (14 to 20 Hz) and beta-2 (24 to 30 Hz) (<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) and that parietal beta-1 may act as a memory buffer activated by strong cortical inputs that feeds forward violations to the PFC (<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Indeed, we found in this study, that in parietal cortex (area 7A) beta was unique and beta was functionally excitatory (positively correlated with violations and local spiking) unlike the other areas. Below, we elaborate on how our results support different models of predictive coding.</p>
                <p>Theta-band coherence and Granger causal interactions were stronger during unpredictable stimuli in the sample interval. These interactions were strongest between superficial layers of V4 and the other members of the network. Theta-band interactions were not previously proposed as candidates for processing unpredictable stimuli. However, theta is well known to be a slow rhythm in which faster rhythms such as gamma, can nest (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">60</xref><xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) and aid long-range communication (<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In addition, a previous study identified theta as a carrier for feedforward interactions in the visual system (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In predictive routing, whatever mechanisms are already in place for feedforward processing are enhanced during unpredictable processing. Therefore, it makes sense that theta (and gamma) from V4 to higher-order cortex is enhanced during unpredicted stimuli, because this reflects an up-regulation of the feedforward channel.</p>

                <title>Unpredicted Stimuli Enhance Spiking in Superficial Layers.</title>
                <p>At each level of the cortical hierarchy tested, neurons spiked more to, and carried more information about, unpredictable compared to predicted stimuli. Neurons in superficial cortical layers (L2/3) of V4 showed stronger effects than deep layers. In addition, only superficial layers had unpredicted spiking selective to the predicted stimulus. Superficial layers 2/3 contain the majority of feedforward projecting cells. This laminar specificity suggests that unpredicted inputs are preferentially processed in superficial layers and fed forward.</p>

                <title>Spiking Reflects an Upcoming Predictable Stimulus.</title>
                <p>We found that during trial blocks in which the monkeys could predict the upcoming stimulus, all cortical areas we recorded carried information about it before it appeared. PFC contained the most prestimulus information. In addition, we found that deep layers held more information about the upcoming sample than superficial layers. This is consistent with hierarchical models that propose that generating predictions is primarily a function of higher than sensory cortex and deep layers.</p>

                <title>Modulation of Rhythms by Prediction Are Layer Dependent.</title>
                <p>In all areas studied, unpredictable stimuli evoked more gamma (40 to 90 Hz) power and less alpha/beta (8 to 30 Hz) power compared to predictable stimuli (beta in area 7A was an exception). These effects were strongest in the first few trials when transitioning from a predictable block to an unpredictable block, potentially reflecting a violation, or prediction error. This effect and the positive correlation between gamma and spiking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2014868117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>) were stronger in superficial than deep cortical layers. There was generally more alpha/beta power to predictable than unpredictable stimuli but layer differences varied by area. This generally supports rhythm-based models positing that gamma transmits prediction errors and alpha/beta transmits predictions.</p>

                <title>Modulation of Rhythms by Prediction Are Stimulus Specific.</title>
                <p>The increases in gamma power (and spiking) with unpredicted stimuli and the increased alpha/beta with predicted stimuli were stimulus specific. Effects were larger at recoding sites where spiking preferred (was greater to) the specific stimulus that was predicted. For spiking, this selectivity occurred only in superficial layers. For gamma, this selectivity was only significant in superficial layers, and for alpha and beta, this selectivity was only significant in deep layers. Therefore, rhythmic modulation of power by predictability is stimulus specific. This supports the view that oscillations can be modulated in a representationally specific way (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), rather than only in a nonspecific way across wide areas of cortex. The specificity is a central feature of predictive routing, where alpha/beta inhibits the pathways that process the specific predicted stimulus and the increased gamma/spiking occurs because the pathways processing other stimuli were not inhibited.</p>

                <title>Networks and Directionality.</title>
                <p>Both coherence and Granger causality analysis showed that rhythmic interactions were modulated by stimulus predictability at several frequencies. Gamma-band coherence within and between areas was higher with unpredictable than predictable stimuli. This effect was largest for coherence between superficial layers of areas V4 and PFC. Granger causality analysis further showed that the increase in gamma-band coherence with unpredictable stimuli was stronger in the feedforward than feedback direction. In V4, this was more prominent in superficial layers. There was overall greater alpha/beta coherence with predictable stimuli. The strongest effects involved PFC and were stronger in the feedback compared to feedforward direction. In the presample interval, the enhanced Granger causality during predictable stimuli was strongest between deep layers of PFC to the rest of the network. These results are in line with hierarchical and rhythms models where (gamma-based) prediction errors primarily feed forward flow up the cortical hierarchy and (alpha/beta-based) predictions flow down the cortical hierarchy. They suggest that modulation of interareal synchronization at distinct frequencies is a central mechanism in communicating specific (predicted vs. unpredicted) information (<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">65</xref><xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>).

                <p>Trial-by-trial beta power in all higher-order areas except 7A negatively coupled to both spikes and gamma power in V4. Interestingly, this corticocortical top-down inhibition of V4 spiking was found only in deep layers, despite the fact that anatomically, top-down feedback targets both superficial and deep layers of V4 (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In contrast, the actual effects of prediction on spiking and gamma were stronger in superficial layers. This suggests distinct layers for transmitting top-down prediction signals (in deep layers of V4) vs. bottom-up routing of unpredicted information (in superficial layers of V4). It also suggests a local circuit mechanism in visual cortex where deep layers functionally inhibit activity of superficial layers (<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>).</p>

                <title>Summary.</title>
                <p>Our results suggest a hierarchical layer and frequency-specific framework for top-down vs. bottom-up processing related to stimulus predictability. We interpret the results in a framework we call predictive routing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). Unpredictable stimuli evoked stronger feedforward- superficial-layer gamma/spiking (and theta), especially when they violated a previous prediction: the hallmark of a prediction error signal. Superficial-layer parietal area 7A high beta also signaled violations in both feedforward and feedback directions, which could engage working memory update mechanisms to process and hold unpredicted information online. Coherence and feedback connectivity were enhanced in the alpha/beta band when a stimulus was predictable. In the presample interval this enhanced feedback connectivity during predictable stimuli originated in deep layers of PFC. Alpha/beta power in higher-order cortical areas LIP, FEF, and PFC negatively modulated spiking in deep layers of V4. The modulatory effects of stimulus predictability on alpha/beta and on gamma/spiking modulation was strongest at the sensory cortical sites that preferred the predicted stimulus. Spiking/gamma in sensory cortex was only selective to the predictive stimulus in superficial layers. Alpha/beta was only selective to the predicted stimulus in deep layers. These results are consistent with the predictive routing model, which states that there need not be specialized circuits for extracting prediction error. Rather, when stimuli are predictable, these rhythmic, layer-specific mechanisms prepare and inhibit columns in sensory cortex that process the predicted stimulus. In the absence of these pathway-specific prediction signals, sensory samples receive stronger processing, causing enhanced spiking and feedforward gamma. Together, these results suggest that predictive coding may stem from rhythmic interactions between lower frequency rhythms in deep cortical layers that signal predictions and inhibit the superficial-layer gamma and spiking in the sensory pathways that match those predictions.</p>

                <p>We performed multilaminar recordings using linear array U and V probes (Plexon). We recorded spiking and LFP activity in visual area V4, parietal, and prefrontal cortices of two macaque monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) while the animals performed a delayed match to sample task. All surgical and animal care procedures were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)’s Committee on Animal Care and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute of Health and MIT’s Department of Comparative Medicine.

                <title>Behavioral Training and Task.</title>
                <p>Monkeys were trained to sit comfortably in a primate chair inside a sound attenuating behavioral testing booth. They were seated 50 cm away from a LCD monitor with a 144-Hz refresh rate (ASUS, Taiwan). Using positive reinforcement, we trained monkeys to perform a visual search task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Monkeys fixated on a point at the center of the screen (fixation window radius: 2 to 3 visual degrees) for a duration of 1 s, were presented with one of three cue objects for a duration of 1 s, and were required to maintain fixation over a delay (between 0.5 and 1.2 s). A search array then appeared that consisted of the cued item together with either one or two distractors presented at the same eccentricity (3° to 8°), but different visual quadrants as the cued object. The position of the cued object and the distractors were always randomly chosen. Monkeys were rewarded with a few drops of diluted juice if they performed a saccade toward the cued item. Behavioral performance was high for each of the monkeys (monkey S: 77% over 41 sessions, monkey L: 75% over 30 sessions). Monkeys were trained on this task using a library of 22 sample images. For recordings, we used a subset of these images (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), choosing a total of 3 per session. Most sessions (65 out of 71) used the 3 objects depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>: an orange, a green block, and a blue car.</p>
                <p>To manipulate prediction, the task was performed either with unpredictable or predictable cuing. During unpredictable cuing, samples were randomly drawn on each trial. In block cuing/sampling, the sample was held constant for the duration of the block. The trial-by-trial and blocked modes each lasted for 50 trials before switching block modes. The starting order was randomized over sessions. The task design is schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>.</p>

                <title>Neurophysiological Recordings.</title>
                <p>All of the data were recorded through Blackrock headstages (Blackrock Cereplex M), sampled at 30 kHz, band passed between 0.3 Hz and 7.5 kHz (first order Butterworth high pass and third order Butterworth low pass), and digitized at a 16-bit, 250 nV/bit. All LFPs were recorded with a low-pass 250-Hz Butterworth filter, sampled at 1 kHz, and alternating current (AC) coupled.</p>
                <p>We implanted the monkeys with a custom-machined carbon PEEK chamber system with three recording wells placed over visual/temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex. The process for making the chambers was based on design principles outlined previously (<xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Briefly, we first took an anatomical MRI scan (0.5 mm^3 voxel size) and/or computed tomography (CT) scan to extract the bone and coregister the skull model with the brain tissue. We designed the center of each chamber to overlie the primary recording area of interest and to have an optimal angle for perpendicular recordings relative to the cortical folding. Postoperatively, after the recording chambers were implanted, MRIs were taken with the recording grid in place, filled with water, which created a marker to coregister each possible electrode trajectory with the animal’s anatomy, and to confirm trajectories that were as close to perpendicular as possible.</p>
                <p>The areas where we could achieve perpendicular recordings (for laminar sampling) on the overlying gyrus were V4 (foveal and parafoveal representations), parietal cortex (area 7A), and prefrontal cortex (area 8A, ventro and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex [VLPFC/DLPFC]). The areas where we recorded without laminar alignment (due to their location in sulci) were areas FEF and LIP.</p>
                <p>We recorded a total of 71 sessions with laminar probes. In each session, we inserted between 1 and 3 laminar probes (“U probes” and “V probes” from Plexon) into each recording chamber with either 100- or 200-μm intersite spacing and either 16 or 32 total electrodes per probe. This gave a total linear sampling of 3.0 to 3.1 mm on each probe. Between three and seven probes in total per session were used, with a total channel count ranging between 48 and 128 electrodes per session. The recording reference was the reinforcement tube, which made metallic contact with the entire length of the probe (total probe length from connector to tip was 70 mm). Some U/V probes had noisy channels (average power greater than 2 SDs above the mean of all channels, this occurred on less than 5% of all channels), which were interpolated based on nearest neighbors prior to analysis.</p>

                <p>For the analysis of the analog MUA we band-pass filtered the raw, unfiltered, 30-kHz sampled data into a wide band between 500 and 5,000 Hz, the power range dominated by spikes. The signal was then low-pass filtered at 250 Hz and resampled to 1,000 kHz. The advantage of this signal is that it captures all nearby units, including those with low signal-to-noise ratio that would not be captured with a strict threshold. For the analysis of thresholded spikes, we manually sorted spikes using a Plexon offline sorter.

                <p>All analyses were performed with customized MATLAB scripts and with Fieldtrip software (<xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Bipolar derivation is a recommended prestep prior to Granger causality and coherence analysis, as the presence of a common reference can lead to spurious results (<xref rid="r72" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). In addition, bipolar derivation enhances the spatial localization of LFP signals and removes the common reference and any common noise or volume conduction in the signal (<xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Here, we computed the sample-by-sample bipolar differences by subtracting contacts that were at a distance of 400 μm: next-nearest neighbors for the laminar probe data spaced at 200 μm between contacts, and next-next-nearest neighbors for the probe data spaced at 100 μm between contacts.</p>
                <p>We then estimated power, coherence, and Granger causality on these bipolar derivations. We estimated power at all frequencies from 0 to 250 Hz using multitaper spectral estimation (smoothing window of 5 Hz), leading to nine tapers per spectral estimate, using window sizes of 1 s (0 to 1 s relative to sample onset is the period of visual stimulation, −1 to 0 s relative to sample onset is the prestimulus fixation interval) per trial. These Fourier coefficients were then used to calculate the cross-spectral density matrix, from which we derived coherence and nonparametric spectral Granger causality (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p>
