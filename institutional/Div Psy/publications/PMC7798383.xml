                <p id="Par1">Intrusive memories are common after trauma, and can cause significant distress. Interventions to prevent/reduce the occurrence of this core clinical feature of posttraumatic stress disorder are needed; they should be easy to deliver, readily disseminated and scalable. A novel one-session intervention by Iyadurai et al. 2018, <italic>Molecular Psychiatry</italic>, resulted in intrusion reduction over the subsequent week. Its feasibility in a different setting and longer-term effects (&gt;1 month) need investigation. We conducted an exploratory open-label pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the feasibility and effects of a brief behavioural intervention to reduce intrusive memories in trauma-exposed patients in a Swedish hospital emergency department (ED). Participants (final <italic>N</italic>â=â41) were randomly allocated to either intervention (including memory reminder cue then visuospatial cognitive task âTetrisâ with mental rotation instructions) or active control (podcast) condition within 72âh of presenting to the ED (both conditions using their smartphone). Findings were examined descriptively. We estimated between-group effect sizes for the number of intrusive memories post-intervention at week 1 (primary outcome) and week 5 (secondary outcome). Compared to the control condition, participants in the intervention condition reported fewer intrusive memories of trauma, both at week 1 and week 5. Findings extend the previous evaluation in the UK. The intervention was readily implemented in a different international context, with a mixed trauma sample, with treatment gains maintained at 1 month and associated with some functional improvements. Findings inform future trials to evaluate the capacity of the cognitive task intervention to reduce the occurrence of intrusive memories after traumatic events.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Intrusive memories of traumatic events are commonly experienced in the aftermath of psychological trauma. They come to mind involuntarily, are repetitive, and can elicit significant distress and impair functioning. Intrusive memories are the cardinal symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These sensory memories typically comprise visual mental imagery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> from moments in the trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Intrusions in the acute post-trauma phase have been centrally associated with other acute posttraumatic stress symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and the intrusion symptom cluster is associated with the longitudinal course of PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Interventions to target intrusive memories in the acute phase may help because intrusions can be distressing in their own right<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, it is possible that early intrusions could serve as a âclinical markerâ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> for persistent intrusions and PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">To have meaningful impact given the global scale of trauma, it would be helpful to have interventions that are simple to administer and accessible outside traditional psychotherapy settings, e.g., in hospitals (following medical trauma), or community settings (e.g., after major accidents or terror attacks), as well as scalable (e.g., for trauma-exposed individuals who are refugees or vulnerable groups during a pandemic). Current evidence-based psychological treatments after trauma include numerous components to address the breadth of symptom clusters which make up the PTSD diagnosis. Meanwhile NICE guidelines for PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> now consider interventions targeted at <italic>specific symptoms</italic> in some circumstances such as when other interventions are not available. Holmes and colleagues developed a preventative approach targeting just one core clinical feature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> after trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This novel, brief behavioural intervention to reduce the number of intrusive memories soon after trauma draws on ideas from cognitive science (cognitive task interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>/memory (re)consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) rather than traditional exposure models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The cognitive task intervention comprises several parts including a brief memory reminder/orientation (to re-/activate specific trauma memory âhotspotsâ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>), followed by a visuospatial cognitive interference task (e.g., playing computer game âTetrisâ alongside training to engage in âmental rotationâ throughout), administered according to specific timings and order. This task is theorised to interfere with (re)consolidation of visuospatial components of the trauma memory, targeted at those memory segments that intrude (hotspots). Laboratory research using experimental trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> demonstrated that the intervention reduces the number of intrusions over the subsequent week compared to control conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Moving from the laboratory to clinical settings with individuals exposed to real trauma, accruing preliminary evidence suggests the intervention may reduce the occurrence of intrusive memories both when recently acquired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and longstanding (consolidated)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. For example, women who completed the intervention soon after traumatic childbirth (6âh after an emergency caesarean section in a Swiss hospital) reported fewer intrusive memories (by 48%) in the subsequent week relative to the (usual care) control condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. For psychiatric inpatients (in Germany) with complex PTSD and longstanding intrusive trauma memories, those intrusions targeted by the intervention (procedure adapted for older memories) reduced by 64% from pre- to post-intervention compared to a reduction of 11% for non-targeted intrusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Iyadurai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> reported that motor vehicle accident survivors in a UK hospital emergency department (ED) who received the intervention (delivered by a clinical psychologist) up to 6âh post-accident reported fewer intrusions over the subsequent week (by 62%) relative to participants in an active control (activity log task) condition (<italic>d</italic>â=â0.67, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.14)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. There were convergent findings on a clinical measure of distress related to posttraumatic stress intrusion symptoms at 1 week (IES-R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>), but not for other symptom clusters. The primary outcome (intrusive memory diary) was administered at 1 week (as in earlier laboratory studies), but not re-administered after 1 month. No between-group differences were found at 1 month (see Iyadurai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The authors noted that the study was designed to detect an effect on the primary outcome measure at 1 week (diary), thus there may have been insufficient power to test secondary hypotheses, warranting a larger trial powered to detect differences at 1 month.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Questionnaires at each timepoint.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Day 1 (Baseline)</th><th>Week 1</th><th>1 month</th><th>Week 5</th><th>3 months</th><th>6 months</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="7"><italic>Emergency department</italic></td></tr><tr><td>âDemographics</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âPsychological/medical/ trauma history</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âPerceived threat</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âPDEQ</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âPDI</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âCredibility/Expectancy Questionnaire</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âSRHR</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>âSRSR</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><italic>After discharge</italic></td></tr><tr><td>âIntrusive memory diary</td><td/><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âIES-R</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>âHADS</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>âPSS</td><td/><td/><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âWSAS</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>âFeedback Questionnaire about participation</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>âSensory modality of intrusive memories</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>âMINI section H<sup>a</sup></td><td/><td/><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>IES-R</italic> Impact of Event ScaleâRevised, <italic>HADS</italic> Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, <italic>WSAS</italic> Work and Social Adjustment Scale, <italic>SRHR</italic> Self Rated Health Rating, <italic>SRSR</italic> Self-Rated Sleep Ratings, <italic>PDEQ</italic> Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, <italic>PDI</italic> Peritraumatic Distress Inventory, <italic>PSS</italic> Perceived Stress Scale, <italic>MINI</italic> The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.</p><p><sup>a</sup>Completed via telephone.</p><p>Implementation feedback and information on adverse events was also collected (see Materials a and Methods).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
              <p id="Par7">A further limitation of Iyadurai et al.âs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> study is that the intervention and control conditions differed in the way in which they were delivered (intervention task on a game console, control task using pen-and-paper). Moreover, all participants were survivors of a motor vehicle accident, leaving untested the question of whether findings extend to a mixed trauma sample. Follow-up trials to Iyadurai et al.âs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> preliminary investigation are therefore needed.</p>
              <p id="Par8">The main aim of the current pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the effects of the simple cognitive task intervention on intrusive memories, and other symptoms, after a traumatic event, with follow-ups at both 1 week and 1 month, and where possible 3 and 6 months. The intervention task was delivered by smartphone (rather than game console) and more closely matched to the control condition (a podcast, also via smartphone)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We employed a more diverse trauma sample not limited to motor vehicle accident survivors. We examined whether the intervention could be effectively implemented in a new hospital and international context (Sweden), following initial feasibility work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The aim of the present exploratory pilot study was to present descriptive results, rather than a test of statistical significance. We conducted planned analyses to obtain an estimate of effect size of the difference between conditions on the number of intrusive memories (diary). Such information can guide the design, including power and sample size estimation, of future follow-up RCTs.</p>
              <p id="Par9">As noted, we used the intrusive memory diary to monitor intrusions in week 1 post-trauma in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, but not beyond. We were interested in the feasibility of also administering it at week 5 to inform its potential as an outcome measure in future trials. Participants therefore monitored their intrusive memories in the diary in two separate weeks (week 1 and week 5). The Clinical Trial Registration (NCT03509792) lists number of intrusive memories at âone monthâ (rather than at week 5) as the secondary outcome. For the sake of clarity, we have opted to refer to this measure as taken at week 5, to specify the timing of the diary measure over a full week (during week 5) in relation to the administration of the intervention/control task (day 1). The intervention was delivered by students (Psychology MSc) rather than qualified mental health professionals. For such implementation, each team member received several training sessions, following a formal training protocol including role-play, feedback and observation of initial cases. Finally, we included additional measures of functional impairment, to more thoroughly gauge the extent to which any reductions in intrusive memories were associated with functional gains (e.g., sleep, concentration).</p>
              <p id="Par10">In summary, this pilot RCT aimed to investigate the feasibility and effects of a cognitive task intervention versus active control on the number of intrusive memories of trauma at week 1 (primary outcome) and week 5 (secondary outcome) as well as other symptoms (post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression) and functioning at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months.</p>

Care was taken to ensure that all steps of study participation fitted into wait-times and did not affect medical care provided in the ED. Routine hospital procedures for hygiene and safety were followed. Data collection was conducted by trained research assistants (JW, OK, FS, YW). Study procedures followed a written structured protocol based on previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par27">The behavioural intervention comprised a cognitive task procedure including a brief memory reminder procedure (so that the individualâs hotspots were held in mind) prior to engaging in a visuospatial interference taskâplaying the computer game Tetrisâwith specific instructions for âmental rotationâ. The memory reminder procedure consisted of completing the âhotspotsâ sheet; i.e., participants briefly named their worst moment images within the traumatic event and listed them on a sheet of paper. This sheet remained in front of the participant for the duration of the intervention. For the gameplay component, participants were instructed to actively use âmental rotationâ; i.e., visualise âin their mindâs eyeâ how to rotate/move the Tetris blocks to fit them into horizontal linesâplanning ahead for the next few blocks to appear on the screen. After downloading the app and receiving instructions, participants practiced with the researcher present and then played the game using mental rotation instructions for at least one uninterrupted period of 10âmin, and for ~20âmin in total. Participants were given the option of engaging in self-administered booster sessions after their session in the ED, i.e., play the game in a similar way at home or during daily life if/when intrusive memories occurred. When we revised inclusion criteria, the intervention procedure was adapted accordingly (see <italic>Procedural Changes</italic> in <italic>Supplementary Information</italic>).</p>

                  <p id="Par30">To promote protocol fidelity and appropriate delivery in a hospital setting, it was critical that individuals administering the intervention and control received adequate training, feedback and monitoring. Based on prior feasibility work in Sweden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, we developed formalised training for research assistants to complete prior to delivering the study protocol. Training took place in a group (approximately four students, trained by two experienced clinical psychologists/researchers). Training material (presented in PowerPoint) covered key learning points for all steps of the protocol and included a checklist for trainers and trainees to monitor individual progress.</p>
                  <p id="Par31">Training included (1) a half-day introductory course for Good Clinical Practice; (2) approximately 2 days of initial training comprising key knowledge required to deliver the protocol (i.e., ethical considerations in trauma research, communication skills with trauma patients, how to understand and focus on the crucial parts of the interventionâidentifying hotspots, mental rotation instructions and 20âmin of gameplay), roleplay of crucial parts of the protocol, e.g., (i) taking informed consent, (ii) delivering the intervention, (iii) helping participants understand/complete the intrusive memory diary; (3) reflective group feedback by experienced clinical psychologists on 1 and 2 above, close observation and individual feedback by the supervising clinical psychologists in real-time during recruitment of the first at least three participants; (4) continued real-time supervision via phone/video call regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria, procedural concerns in the ED and intervention delivery as needed; (5) intermittent observations to support adherence to protocol; (6) regular fidelity checks and feedback regarding incoming data acquisition.</p>

                <p id="Par32">Trained research assistants identified potential participants in the ED in collaboration with ED staff. Participants deemed eligible (assessed in consultation with supervising clinical psychologists [EAH, MK] and ED staff) were given further oral and written information about the study. After providing written and informed consent, participants completed baseline assessments, including demographic information and details about the traumatic event that brought them to the ED (<italic>Supplementary Information</italic>).</p>
                <p id="Par33">They were then randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to two parallel treatment conditions using blocked randomisation (block sizeâ=â4) performed by a clinical trials unit (Karolinska Trial Alliance) with a web-based randomisation system (from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">http://www.randomization.com/</ext-link>). In line with Iyadurai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, randomisation was carried out using stratification based on perceived threat to self/other. The sequentially numbered randomisation envelopes were stored and opened away from participants, and accessed by research assistants after baseline measures had been completed. Participants were only informed that they were to receive âone of two different tasks involving their smartphoneâ; i.e., were not told the condition (intervention/control) to which they were randomised. The researchers delivering the procedures were not blind to condition, as they needed to provide verbal instructions appropriate to the condition to which particiapnts were allocated.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Following randomisation, participants completed procedures according to condition assignment (see section âTreatment conditionsâ). Finally, participants were given an intrusive memory diary to assess the primary and secondary outcome (number of intrusions week 1 and week 5), and instructions for how to complete the diary. For further details regarding follow-ups at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months, see Supplementary Information and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Recruitment started in January 2019 and stopped in June 2019 after reaching the planned sample size. After 1 month, follow-up participants received a cinema voucher (value approximately USD 12) as reimbursement for their time. The last follow-up assessment was completed in December 2019.</p>

              <title>Discussion/conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par51">This exploratory open-label pilot RCT investigated the feasibility and effects of a brief cognitive task intervention (including Tetris gameplay as one of several components) on intrusive memories of trauma in individuals who presented to the ED. Relative to the active control condition, trauma-exposed individuals who received the intervention reported fewer intrusive memories in the subsequent week (48% fewer in intervention compared to control condition), consistent with the direction of previous findings with analogue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and real-world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> trauma. A between-group difference was maintained 1 month later; i.e., for intrusions reported in the week 5 diary (90% fewer in intervention compared to control condition). Notably, ratings of credibility (i.e., whether participants expected the intervention/control task to work) were similar and in the mid-range in both conditions, suggesting expectancy effects were unlikely to drive group differences. Results establish the daily diary as a feasible tool with which to monitor intrusions not only at week 1 but also at week 5 post-intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par52">The overall pattern of means suggests that participants who received the intervention (compared to control) reported less intrusion-related distress (IES-R) and some possible functional improvements (e.g., concentration). As a brief (single session) intervention, initial indication of longer-term effects than previous studies (i.e., beyond 1 week) on aspects of psychological functioning warrant further exploration. That said, we note the reverse pattern for intrusion-related distress at 1 month, and IES-R and concentration disruption at 6 months. Overall, we interpret findings with caution given the exploratory nature of the study, the relatively small sample, and attrition over time.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Participants responded positively to taking part and rated both conditions overall as not burdensome and quite easy to complete. None provided negative feedback in open-ended comments or follow-up telephone interviews (<italic>Supplementary Information</italic>). Most patients approached welcomed the opportunity to participate in the study during waiting-time in the ED, with 88% (101 of 115 eligible participants) willing to complete study procedures. International clinical guidelines for PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> report treatment acceptability using rates of treatment discontinuation. Here, 20 of 22 participants (91%) randomised to the intervention condition completed the treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Feedback from ED staff indicated they were receptive to the study; they supported identification of eligible patients, and appreciated how study procedures fitted around patientsâ medical care. In line with our earlier work exploring feasibility of recruiting in the ED<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, staff welcomed that participants underwent study procedures during the naturally occurring (often long) waiting-times in the ED, as it kept them actively engaged. Overall, this suggests feasibility of delivery in a different international context (Sweden) to that in which the intervention was developed (UK), again in a hospital ED/waiting areas and outside a traditional psychotherapy setting.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Intrusive memories were reported by participants as a result of a broad range of traumas, from minor fall accidents to severe injuries and physical assaults. This speaks to the relevance of a broad recruitment approach, and suggests successful implementation in a mixed trauma sample. One next step will be to investigate whether the intervention can be delivered remotely (e.g., digitally rather than face-to-face), which will have utility when in person meetings are not possible and will maximise the scope of the intervention to prevent intrusive memories at scale.</p>
              <p id="Par56">The unprecedented circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic emphasise the need for remote delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In light of the favourable outcomes of this pilot, we had commenced the abovementioned planned follow-up RCT in the same ED. However, data collection was swiftly suspended in light of the pandemic due to infection risks of COVID-19, and the trial was terminated (CTR: NCT04185155)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In response to informal enquiries from ED staff about using the intervention to address their <italic>own</italic> intrusive memories of trauma, during the pandemic we developed a new study to evaluate the impact of the intervention for frontline healthcare workers (CTR: NCT04460014)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> e.g., for intrusive memories as a result of work with critically ill/dying COVID-19 patients in intensive care. This follow-up RCT builds on this pilot trial and the intervention procedures piloted here, however it uses remote delivery (i.e., digitally rather than in person, using instructional videos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and remote researcher support) due to COVID-19 infection risk. The design and sample size estimation are guided by the between-group effect size in the current pilot findings. Going forward, we look to possibilities to evaluate the intervention in further follow-up trials, in which careful consideration of implementation and adaption to specific context/populations will be important.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Procedures for training the research team to deliver the intervention and monitoring outcomes worked well, and real-time supervision (via phone from the university to the ED) was successfully implemented. Feedback from students indicated the importance of role-play as part of training, and that the imagery-based metaphor âacting like your favourite nurseâ helped them deliver the intervention in a swift and practical manner. They noted that it was important to establish a relationship with ED staff on-site to facilitate recruitment and understanding of the ED context, and that instructional videos and further development of the brief checklist for delivering the intervention would be helpful as part of future training. Thus, our training procedures for research staff require more formalisation, write-up and development so that they can be more readily shared and used to train new staff members. As the intervention is in its relative infancy, we consider the development of formalised training and fidelity procedures to be a critical next step in translational research, to ensure effective and consistent delivery of the intervention and study procedures (e.g., daily diary) in subsequent research trials and to facilitate implementation. Adequate training is vital for adaptation to specific contexts, implementation across different settings/centres, and to aid reproducibility efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par58">Compared to traditional psychotherapy, costs of the intervention in its current form are low, as it involves one main session (rather than multiple sessions), and does not rely on delivery by a qualified clinician. We are exploring possibilities such as digital training procedures (to facilitate delivery), which could further reduce costs. Furthermore, the only technical device needed to complete the intervention is the participantâs own smartphone. Future trials could include health economics evaluations to formally establish the costs of the intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par59">We note various limitations of this exploratory open-label pilot RCT in addition to those previously mentioned. First, whilst conceptual accounts of memory (re)consolidation inspired aspects of the behavioural intervention, this study cannot elucidate mechanisms. Second, we opted not to report findings on a measure of sensory features of intrusive memories as items were poorly understood by participants. We stratified participants based on their ratings of perceived threat during the traumatic event, and had intended to do so in a follow-up RCT. However, our pilot data provided no indication of utility of this approach (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Finally, rates of attrition for secondary outcomes (particularly at 6 months) compromise our capacity to make meaningful between-condition comparisons at longer timepoints.</p>
              <p id="Par60">In sum, the global prevalence of trauma necessitates preventive approaches that are simple to deliver at scale. This one-session behavioural intervention resulted in fewer intrusive trauma memories at 1 week and 1 month post-trauma for individuals who presented at the ED. Our next step will be to investigate whether the intervention can contribute to the mental health of frontline healthcare staff by preventing the persistence of intrusive memories of trauma they experience in the context of the pandemic.</p>
