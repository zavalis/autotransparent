                  <p>Despite a reported high rate of mental disorders in refugees, scientific knowledge on their risk of suicide attempt and suicide is scarce. We aimed to investigate (1) the risk of suicide attempt and suicide in refugees in Sweden, according to their country of birth, compared with Swedish-born individuals and (2) to what extent time period effects, socio-demographics, labour market marginalisation (LMM) and morbidity explain these associations.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Three cohorts comprising the entire population of Sweden, 16–64 years at 31 December 1999, 2004 and 2009 (around 5 million each, of which 3.3–5.0% refugees), were followed for 4 years each through register linkage. Additionally, the 2004 cohort was followed for 9 years, to allow analyses by refugees' country of birth. Crude and multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. The multivariate models were adjusted for socio-demographic, LMM and morbidity factors.</p>

                  <p>In multivariate analyses, HRs regarding suicide attempt and suicide in refugees, compared with Swedish-born, ranged from 0.38–1.25 and 0.16–1.20 according to country of birth, respectively. Results were either non-significant or showed lower risks for refugees. Exceptions were refugees from Iran (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14–1.41) for suicide attempt. The risk for suicide attempt in refugees compared with the Swedish-born diminished slightly across time periods.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Due to the increasing global migration in recent years, the demography of Sweden has changed, as it has in several other European countries (Swedish Migration Agency, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Sweden received historically high numbers of individuals seeking asylum in recent years, granting the highest number of asylums per capita in the European Union in 2016 (Eurostat, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In 2017, 18.5% of all people living in Sweden were foreign-born (Statistics Sweden, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>Refugees have been reported to have a high prevalence of common mental disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (Bogic <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tinghög <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), which in turn can lead to suicidal behaviour (suicide attempt and suicide) (Ferrada-Noli <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; van Heeringen, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Suicidal behaviour has a multifactorial aetiology and can be conceptualised by a stress-diathesis model which implies that acquired susceptibility arising from heredity interacts with stressful life events, takes a long-term toll on mental health and subsequently, increases the risk of suicidal behaviour (van Heeringen, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For refugees, the process of migration, accompanied by traumatic experiences of war and torture, hazardous journeys, harsh circumstances in refugee camps and separation from family members (Tinghög, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), can be considered as such stressful life events. Experience of traumatic events may also lead to the development of common mental disorders. Moreover, post-migration difficulties including psychosocial acculturation problems and ethnical discrimination may adversely affect mental health and increase the risk of suicidal behaviour (Berry <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Tinghög, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p>
              <p>Despite this, there is a considerable lack of studies on suicide risk among refugees in an entire host country, and to the best of our knowledge there are no such studies on suicide attempt. One study in Denmark reported a significantly lower risk of suicide for male but not female refugees compared with the Danish-born population (Norredam <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, this study did not investigate differences in risk of suicide in refugees according to country of birth. Such knowledge is crucial as refugees form a heterogeneous group not only in terms of their ethnicity but also regarding the diverse nature of their traumatic experiences (Tinghög, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Here, the culture, the dominating religion, the stigma associated with suicidal behaviour prevailing in the country of birth and the heterogeneity of traumas experienced by the refugees may have an influence on the individual's attitudes towards suicidal behaviour and, if a person acts on suicidal ideation (Tinghög, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Lawrence <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>Research on the risk of suicidal behaviour in refugees should not only consider information on the country of birth, but also on potential time period effects in the association between refugee status and subsequent suicidal behaviour. Here, time period effects might be related to temporal changes in e.g. the design of national social insurance and migration policies and/or the healthcare system in the host country. Several such changes have occurred during the last 20 years in Sweden. For example, mental healthcare reforms in the 1990s aimed at deinstitutionalisation and promoted more community support and outpatient care for individuals with severe mental disorders, which could be important in our study context (Bulow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Moreover, changes towards stricter regulations of the social insurance system in 2008 in Sweden might have affected the degree of labour market marginalisation (LMM) (Wang <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Such changes, in turn, might be related to differential processes regarding acculturation, social integration and healthcare utilisation of refugees, which might be reflected in changes in the risk of suicidal behaviour over time (Tinghög, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Furthermore, changes in the composition of the refugee population in terms of country of birth over the last decades in Sweden (Swedish Migration Agency, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) could also contribute to time period effects. Another important factor that needs attention in relation to possible time period effects is a potential change in rates of LMM over time, as immigrants (including refugees) are reported to be more marginalised at the labour market than individuals in the host country are (Helgesson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has examined to what extent time period effects explain the risk of suicidal behaviour in refugees.</p>

                <title>Design and study population</title>
                <p>In this nationwide study, three cohorts comprising all individuals with a refugee or Swedish-born background, aged 16–64 years and residing in Sweden on the 31 of December in 1999 (<italic>n</italic> = 4 993 691), 2004 (<italic>n</italic> = 5 083 618) and 2009 (<italic>n</italic> = 5 171 135) were followed prospectively with regard to inpatient healthcare due to first incident suicide attempt as well as death due to suicide by means of register linkage for 4 years each. This means a follow-up from 1 January 2000, 2005 and 2010 to 31 December 2003, 2008 and 2013, respectively. The ‘2004’ cohort was also followed for a total of 9 years (until 31 December 2013) to enhance statistical power in the analyses regarding the risk of suicide attempt and suicide in refugees from specific countries of birth. The study population mentioned above excludes individuals with missing or erroneous data regarding their reason for residence (3.7% in the initial 1999 and 2009 cohort, 3.9% in the initial 2004 cohort).</p>

                <p>In this study, all individuals grouped under the headings ‘refugee’, ‘in need of protection’ and ‘humanitarian grounds’ as their reason for residence at the Swedish Migration Agency were identified as refugees (Statistics Sweden, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Refugees were defined according to the Geneva Convention on Refugees – a person who is outside his/her country of citizenship because of well-founded grounds for fear of persecution, and is unable to obtain sanctuary from the home country or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country (UNHCR, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the comparability of the estimates for the outcome measures, i.e. including or excluding individuals who were granted residence permits due to ‘in need of protection’ and on ‘humanitarian grounds’ as refugees. These estimates (data not shown) were similar to our results. All individuals with Sweden as their country of birth were defined as ‘Swedish-born’ in this study. Individuals with missing or erroneous data regarding their reason for residence were excluded from the initial study population (3.7% in the 1999 and 2009 cohort, 3.9% in the 2004 cohort).</p>

                <p>The exposed groups in the analyses were refugees in total and according to their country of birth. The following countries generated the largest number of refugees to Sweden: Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Chile and the former Yugoslavia. Therefore, refugees born in these countries were grouped separately for additional analyses with specific country of birth (<xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="tab03" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The reference group comprised the Swedish-born population, i.e. with Sweden as a country of birth.</p>

Diagnostic information was based on the codes of the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10). Specific diagnoses are mentioned in online Supplementary Table S1. The socio-demographic and LMM factors were measured at the end and during the baseline year of each cohort (1999, 2004 and 2009), respectively. History of suicide attempt and of inpatient healthcare was measured for 5 years preceding the start of the follow-up (1995–1999, 2000–2004 and 2005–2009 for the respective cohort). For the 2004 cohort, in the analyses with 9 years of follow-up, specialised outpatient healthcare was also included and both inpatient and specialised outpatient healthcare were measured for 4 years preceding the start of the follow-up (2001–2004). Inclusion of the specialised outpatient healthcare data improved the coverage of the morbidity factors in the 2004 cohort with 9 years of follow-up. However, these data were only available from 2001 and onwards. Therefore, to ensure comparability, they were not included for adjustment in the 4-year-follow-up cohorts (1999, 2004 and 2009 cohorts). Missing values for a covariate were categorised in separate categories. <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the categorisation of the covariates.

                <p>In this study, the outcome measures comprised inpatient healthcare due to suicide attempt and death due to suicide, coded according to ICD-10 codes: X60-X84. Events of undetermined intent (ICD-10 codes: Y10-Y34) were included to limit the potential effects of underreporting and regional and temporal variations in case ascertainment (Linsley <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Mittendorfer Rutz and Wasserman, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Runeson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

                <p>Sex- and age-standardised rates of suicide attempt and suicide for refugees were calculated using Swedish-born as the reference population (Yuan, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The ratios of the rate of suicide attempt and the rate of suicide were also calculated for both Swedish-born and the refugees. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to compare refugees in general and from different countries with the Swedish-born population regarding subsequent suicide attempt and suicide. Additionally, sex- and age-stratified regression models were generated (online Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Results were shown as crude and multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Covariates were adjusted for in the following manner: Model 1 – socio-demographic covariates; Model 2 – LMM factors and factors in Model 1 and Model 3 – morbidity factors and factors in Model 2. Data were censored in the event of emigration, death due to a cause other than suicide and, end of follow-up, whichever occurred first. The assumption of the proportional hazard was confirmed by plotting log-minus-log Kaplan–Meier survival curves in SPSS version 25. All other analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>There was a chronological increase in the number of refugees across the three time periods in the Swedish population as shown in <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Generally, in all three cohorts, the refugees comprised more men and younger individuals relative to the sex and age composition in the Swedish-born population. Refugees had fewer years of education and were more often cohabiting with a partner and children in comparison with the Swedish-born. In all cohorts, almost half of the refugee population was living in big cities compared with a third of the Swedish-born population (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A higher proportion of refugees received unemployment benefit at baseline in all the cohorts, compared with the Swedish-born population. A lower proportion of refugees than Swedish-born was recipients of sickness absence benefit or disability pension in the 1999 cohort while a higher proportion of refugees than Swedish-born received such benefits in the 2009 cohort (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Slightly higher proportions with history of inpatient healthcare and almost the same distribution of history of suicide attempt were observed among the refugees and the Swedish-born population in all the cohorts. Sex- and age-standardised suicide attempt rates were lower in refugees, compared with the Swedish-born in the 2009 cohort but higher in the earlier cohorts. Refugees had lower suicide rates (standardised) than Swedish-born in all the cohorts. However, the ratios of suicide attempt rate against the suicide rate were consistently higher in refugees across the three cohorts (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Suicide attempt</title>
                <p>During the 2005–2013 follow-up period, refugees, in total, had a lower risk of suicide attempt compared with the Swedish-born in the multivariate analyses (HR 0.82). When stratifying the data by sex and three age groups (16–24, 25–44 and 45–64 years), a lower risk of suicide attempt compared with the Swedish-born population was observed in the fully adjusted models in all strata (HRs ranged from 0.63 to 0. 9) and the lower risks were statistically significant in refugee women 25–44 years, refugee men 16–24 years and refugee men 25–44 years (online Supplementary Table S2). The risk of suicide attempt in refugees from the African region was also lower compared with the Swedish-born population, but no significant differences were observed for refugees from Asia and South America in the adjusted models. However, the risk estimates of suicide attempt among the included Asian countries varied. Refugees from Iraq had a significantly lower risk of suicide attempt (HR 0.85) in the adjusted analysis whilst refugees from Iran had a significantly higher risk of suicide attempt (HR 1.66 and 1.25 in the crude and multivariate models, respectively). The risk of suicide attempt in refugees in comparison with the Swedish-born population, in general and according to their region or country of birth, was marginally explained by socio-demographics but not previous LMM and morbidity factors (<xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>Compared with the Swedish-born population, almost all refugee groups, according to their country of birth, had a lower risk of suicide attempt and suicide during a 9-year follow-up period. The risk of suicide attempt in refugees from Asian and South American countries was mostly non-significant, but higher in the case of Iran, compared with the Swedish-born. Risk estimates for suicide attempt decreased slightly across time. A number of covariates including socio-demographics, previous LMM and morbidity factors only marginally influenced the associations between refugee status and subsequent suicide attempt and suicide.</p>
                <p>The risk of suicide attempt and suicide was found to be lower, compared with the Swedish-born population, in the majority of the refugee groups in our study. Several factors may have contributed to these findings. First, the ‘healthy migrant effect’ may hold true for refugees (Norredam <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A health selection bias might have occurred for the refugees who were able to overcome the pre- and peri-migratory difficult circumstances to reach the new country. Second, our refugee population had already received residence permits in Sweden at inclusion and asylum seekers were not part of our cohorts. Previously, higher rates of suicidal behaviour in asylum seekers, compared with the Dutch population were reported (Goosen <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The difference between our results and these findings could partly be due to the stressors related to the asylum process, which might have been overcome in the refugee groups who were already residents in Sweden (Goosen <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, around 85% of the refugees in all the cohorts in this study had been residing in Sweden for longer than 5 years (data not shown). The long duration of residence in the host country may have helped them to overcome some of the most acute difficulties associated with acculturation and build up family and community connections, that in turn might have worked in a protective way against suicidal behaviour in these longer established refugee groups.</p>
                <p>Moreover, since most of the refugee groups were from Muslim majority countries, alcohol consumption, an important potential confounder in this context that has been related to suicide, could be lower in this refugee population than in the Swedish-born population (Amundsen, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), which may partly explain the lower risk of suicidal behaviour in refugees. Finally, cultural differences in the experience, expression and stigmatisation of mental disorders, in addition to the differences in culture and religion-driven attitudes towards suicidal behaviour in refugees and the Swedish-born population could also have influenced our results.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec5-2" sec-type="other">
                <title>Risk of suicide attempt</title>
                <p>We found a significantly lower risk of suicide attempt in refugees compared with the Swedish-born population. The risk of suicide attempt was significantly lower in refugees from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and former Yugoslavia, compared with the Swedish-born population. Although there are no previous studies on this research question available for comparison, lower suicide attempt rates, similar to our findings, have been reported earlier for migrants (not distinguishing between refugees and non-refugee migrants) from former Yugoslavia and Ethiopia (Westman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Bursztein Lipsicas <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
                <p>One notable finding in our study is that, compared with the Swedish-born, refugees from Iran had higher risk estimates of suicide attempt in the adjusted analyses (<xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Previously, a study reported significantly higher age-adjusted HRs of suicide attempt for migrants from Iran compared with the Swedish-born comparison group (Westman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). A majority of the refugees from Iran in Sweden were reported to be more secular and more educated than the general population in Iran (Lewin, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Factors related to this apparent heightened risk for suicide attempts compared with the Swedish-born should be further explored.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec5-3" sec-type="other">
                <title>Risk of suicide</title>
                <p>Our results showed lower risk estimates of suicide in refugees, altogether and stratified by sex and age groups, with some variation across country of birth. Because of the lack of previous studies that investigated the risk of suicide in refugees from specific countries of birth, these findings are not directly comparable with any previous results. However, a lower risk of suicide for male but not for female refugees, compared with their native Danish counterparts, reported by Norredam <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref> also partially agrees with our findings. Moreover, previous studies reported a lower risk of suicide in immigrant subgroups according to their region of birth, compared with the population in the host country (Di Thiene <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Puzo <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Our results can be considered to be in line with these findings because the migrant groups from Africa and the Middle East in these studies were mainly comprised people from the main refugee-generating countries to Sweden.</p>
                <p>Although, in comparison with the Swedish-born, we found a lower risk of suicide in most refugee groups according to their country of birth, the ratios of the suicide attempt rate over the suicide rate were consistently higher in refugees across all the time period cohorts. This may reflect a higher stigmatisation of suicide than suicide attempt in refugees compared with the Swedish-born. Moreover, the choice of more lethal suicide methods in the Swedish-born may also contribute to this finding. Future studies are required to investigate such associations.</p>

                <title>Time period effects</title>
                <p>Our results indicated minor time period effects in the association of refugee status and subsequent suicide attempt – the risk estimate decreased from 1999 through 2004 to 2009 cohorts. This suggests that changes in health care management, social insurance regulations and migration policies might have no major influence in the association between refugee status and subsequent suicide attempt. Therefore, national level policy changes regarding mental healthcare and social insurance systems that happened in Sweden during the aforementioned periods are unlikely in themselves to account for the risk of suicidal behaviour in refugees.</p>

              <sec id="sec5-5" sec-type="other">
                <title>Influence of covariates</title>
                <p>Socio-demographic, previous LMM and morbidity factors had only a marginal effect on the estimates in the adjusted models. This is surprising due to the observed differences in these covariates between refugees and the Swedish-born population. While the possibility of residual confounding in the measurement of the covariates cannot be fully disregarded, it seems likely that the reduced risk of suicide attempt and suicide among refugees is driven by other factors than the covariates mentioned. Therefore, more knowledge on risk and particularly also protective factors of suicidal behaviour in refugees is warranted.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The use of high-quality nationwide register data (Brooke <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and using a prospective cohort design are strengths of this study. This allowed us to follow the whole population of Sweden at different time points regarding rare outcome measures like suicide attempt and suicide. We could also stratify the analyses according to the specific countries of birth of refugees. Additionally, the possibility to adjust for an array of socio-demographic, previous LMM and morbidity confounders is another strength of this study.</p>
                <p>There are also limitations to be considered. We included only the suicide attempts registered in inpatient healthcare. Previously, among suicide attempters, only 25% were estimated to have received hospitalised care (Krug <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Therefore, we may not draw conclusions on less severe forms of suicide attempts. Also, reliance on hospital-based sources means that the underreporting of suicide attempts could have been differential in this study. For example, due to religious and cultural stigma, suicide attempts might be more underreported in refugees than in the Swedish-born population. However, the inclusion of events of undetermined intent (ICD-10 codes: Y10–Y34) in our study may have, to some extent, reduced this sort of reporting bias. Second, the refugee population in this study consisted also of individuals, who were granted residence permit on ‘in need of protection’ and ‘humanitarian grounds’. Generally, morbidity in the latter group is considered to be more than any other group of people who get residence permits in Sweden (Hollander <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This might have introduced some negative mental health selection in the refugee group in our study. However, our sensitivity analyses, including and excluding these individuals, revealed no significant differences in the results (data not shown). Additionally, there might be some residual confounding in our analyses regarding the measurement of the covariates. For example, specialised healthcare covers only the most severe forms of morbidity and refugees might be underrepresented due to lower healthcare seeking and differences in access to specialised healthcare (Sundvall <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also, register data regarding morbidity factors could be less complete in refugees, compared with the Swedish-born population, because of their shorter duration of residence in Sweden. Moreover, we could not adjust for some potential confounders in the analyses of the risk of suicide attempt and suicide, e.g. alcohol consumption, due to the lack of data. There might be differences in rates of suicidal behaviour in refugees compared with individuals in their respective countries of birth. Still, the scarceness of studies and low quality of data in most of the countries of birth of refugees make a consistent comparison of rates of suicidal behaviour impossible. Finally, our findings are probably not generalisable to other settings such as refugee camps, asylum seeking populations, refugees to low or middle income countries or countries with stricter regulations regarding immigration.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Despite reported higher rates of mental disorders in refugees in previous studies, we found a lower risk of suicide attempt and suicide in refugees compared with the Swedish-born population. The risk of suicide attempt in refugees decreased somewhat with time. The association between the refugee status and subsequent suicidal behaviour was not explained by a number of confounders. Future studies are warranted to increase our knowledge regarding both risk and protective factors for suicide attempt and suicide in refugee populations.</p>
