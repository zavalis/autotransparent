                  <p>Upregulation to negative-valence images in the cognitive reappraisal task caused increased unpleasantness ratings, corrugator activity, and heart rate compared to downregulation. Upregulation to both negative- and neutral-valence images caused increased skin conductance responses. Oxazepam caused lower unpleasantness ratings to negative-valence stimuli, but did not interact with reappraisal instruction on any outcome. Self-rated trait empathy was associated with stronger responses to negative-valence stimuli, whereas self-rated psychopathic traits were associated with weaker responses to negative-valence stimuli.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Emotional regulation is an important aspect of normal behavior in healthy individuals and often altered in patients with psychiatric disorders, including emotional instability and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggesting a less effective top-down control of emotional processes. Pharmacological substances such as benzodiazepines provide a rapid anxiolytic effect, but are associated with a risk for dependency. Anecdotally, benzodiazepines have been reported to be used to disinhibit criminal violent behavior [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This disinhibition theory of criminal violent behaviour suggests that either empathy processes or top-down regulatory processes are suppressed by benzodiazepines. However, previous studies have not tested whether benzodiazepines affect top-down regulation of emotion.</p>
                <p>One strategy to regulate emotions is through reappraising emotional stimuli in a non-emotional way. Cognitive reappraisal represents an explicit top-down regulatory mechanism in the processing of emotional stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In functional brain imaging studies, cognitive reappraisal has been associated with activity particularly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These areas are proposed to exert top-down control over emotional processing in limbic brain structures including the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cognitive reappraisal is important in psychiatric conditions involving anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which may be associated with insufficient top-down control [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One meta-analysis of fMRI studies found that patients with mood and anxiety disorders showed less activation than healthy controls during cognitive reappraisal in areas including the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Training in cognitive reappraisal can also be part of a treatment for depression, as well as other psychiatric conditions (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>])</p>
                <p>Benzodiazepines are anxiolytic drugs acting through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of <italic>α</italic>, <italic>β</italic>, and <italic>γ</italic> subunits. Anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are suggested to be mediated primarily by the <italic>α</italic>-2 subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], expressed particularly in the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Conversely, sedative and anticonvulsant effects are likely mediated mainly by <italic>α</italic>-1 subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, highly expressed in the cerebral cortex [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In laboratory settings, benzodiazepines have been shown to enhance the response to positive vs negative words, modulate emotional memory, and inhibit recognition of facial expressions of anger [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It has been shown that increased activity in amygdala and insula associated to fear and anxiety processing are suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with benzodiazepines in humans [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One benzodiazepine with a clear anxiolytic effect, but with less sedative properties than many other benzodiazepines is oxazepam. We have previously tested the hypothesis that 20 mg oxazepam would inhibit empathy for pain, finding no conclusive evidence for such an effect [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another possible explanation for instrumental use of benzodiazepines could be that they, often in combination with alcohol, reduce the ability to regulate emotional responses and thereby cause increased aggression. This would suggest an interaction between top-down regulatory mechanisms and treatment with benzodiazepines. This hypothesis is especially interesting since areas in prefrontal cortex that are involved in emotional regulation have high concentrations of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, suggesting a putative mechanism by which the GABA<sub>A</sub> system may impact emotional regulation efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
                <p>Thus, both cognitive reappraisal and benzodiazepines may be associated with inhibition of unpleasantness in response to negatively valenced emotional stimuli, and both act upon the amygdala. However, it is not known whether these regulatory processes interact or act independently on emotional processing.</p>
                <p>We investigated the effects of 25 mg oxazepam in a study encompassing three different experiments targeting different types of emotional processing: emotional mimicry, empathy for pain, and cognitive reappraisal. This paper reports results from the cognitive reappraisal experiment. Results from the experiments on emotional mimicry and empathy for pain have been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the primary findings were that 25 mg oxazepam did not have a major effect on emotional mimicry nor on empathy for pain. Cognitive reappraisal can be thought of as a higher-level top-down emotion regulating function, mechanistically distinct from the more bottom-up processes of emotional mimicry and empathy for pain.</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p>We aimed to investigate effects of 25 mg oxazepam and cognitive reappraisal on emotion-related outcomes. The main hypothesis was that oxazepam would be associated with a reduced ability to regulate emotions through cognitive reappraisal. To capture subjective experience as well as psycho-physiological aspects of emotion, we investigated participants’ ratings of unpleasantness, skin conductance, heart rate and facial EMG. Additionally, we explored associations of personality traits related to empathy, psychopathy and anxiety to emotional regulation.</p>

              <p>The study was approved by the regional ethical review board of Stockholm (no. 2009/1128-31/3). Participants gave written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This experiment formed part of a larger study on the effects of oxazepam on social emotional processes. For a detailed description, see [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, participants were randomised to 25 mg oxazepam or placebo in a double-blind between-groups design, and underwent experiments on emotional mimicry, empathy for pain, and cognitive reappraisal. This paper reports effects of oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal. The study was performed in two waves. Stimuli were balanced over regulation instructions using two different trial lists. Due to an error in randomisation in wave 1, stimulus images were not balanced between instructions to upregulate and downregulate emotional response. Therefore only data from wave 2 were analysed for the experiment on cognitive reappraisal.</p>

              <sec id="sec011">
                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>As described in [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], participants were required to be right-handed, male, 18-45 years of age, to have no history of neurological or psychiatric disease including substance abuse, to speak and understand Swedish fluently, and not to be habitual consumers of nicotine, to reduce the risk of abstinence symptoms during the experiment. Furthermore, students of psychology, behavioural sciences, and medicine (past the 3rd semester) were not included, because training in medicine may cause a more detached attitude towards images of injured and sick people, which were used in the experiment, and because students of psychology and behavioural science may be prone to metacogitate and use different strategies for emotional regulation. We aimed for a sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 40, with 20 participants in each of the two treatment groups, based on pragmatic considerations. Participants were paid 500 SEK (approx. 50 Euro or 60 USD), subject to tax.</p>

                <title>Stimuli and experimental paradigm</title>
                <p>The experimental paradigm was adapted from [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Participants were shown negative and neutral stimuli following an instruction to either upregulate or downregulate their emotional response, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0249065.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The reappraisal instruction was shown for 2 seconds, followed immediately by the image, which was shown for 1 second. Stimulus images were chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On normative ratings, negative images had a mean valence of 20.2 [SD 0.25], and neutral images had a mean valence of 5.02 [0.05]. Participants were asked to either upregulate or downregulate their emotional response by cognitive reappraisal, i.e. imagining different contexts for the situations shown in the images, such as a fictitious situation (downregulation) or something happening to someone close to them (upregulation). Participants were specifically instructed not to close their eyes or look away. In total, each participant was shown 64 trials, 16 of each category (upregulate/downregulate, neutral/negative). After each stimulus, participants were asked to rate their perceived unpleasantness on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100. Before the experiment, participants underwent a demonstration session, and were then asked to explain the instructions back to the experimenter in order to ensure that the instructions were understood. Stimuli were shown using the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA) on a computer screen. Stimulus presentation code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.31480">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.31480</ext-link>. For a further verification that emotional regulation took place, we administered a recall test online, where participants were asked to say whether they recalled images from the experiment, as well as valence-matched images from the IAPS that had not been shown in the experiment. The data from the recall test were unfortunately lost when the online test platform upgraded their software.</p>

                <title>Physiological measures</title>
                <p>We recorded skin conductance, electromyographic (EMG) activity over the superciliary corrugator muscle, and heart rate, as described in [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>Briefly, skin conductance responses were measured using Ag/AgCl finger electrodes (TSD203, Biopac Systems, Inc.), connected to a GSR100C amplifier (Biopac Systems, Inc.) with the following acquisitions settings: 5 <italic>μ</italic>℧/V, 1 Hz low-pass filter, and direct current. To remove non-physiological noise, data were further filtered in the Acqknowledge software using a low pass filter with a 1 Hz cutoff and 4000 coefficients and converted from direct to alternating current using an 0.05 Hz high pass filter. Responses were averaged over a time window of 2 seconds. The time window for analysis was chosen based on inspection of data.</p>
                <p>EMG was measured following established guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with 4 mm Ag-AgCl electrodes (EL254S, Biopac Systems, Inc.) connected to EMG100C amplifiers (Biopac Systems, Inc.) with the following acquisition settings: gain 500, low-pass filter 500 Hz, notch filter off, and high-pass filter 10 Hz. Sampling was at 1000 Hz. The signal was further filtered in the Acqknowledge software using a band pass filter of 30 to 300 Hz to remove signal not due to muscle activity. A band stop filter at 49 to 51 Hz was used to filter out line noise. Average rectified EMG signal was determined. Recordings were downsampled to 100 Hz in order to decrease file size, and data were exported as text files. Before analyses, recordings were further downsampled to 10 Hz using a loess curve in R. Responses were averaged over a time window of 2 seconds and log-transformed before statistical analysis, in order to better approximate a normal distribution. The time window for analysis was chosen based on inspection of data.</p>
                <p>A 3-lead EKG was acquired using Ag/AgCl electrodes (EL503, Biopac Systems, Inc.) with ECG100 amplifiers (Biopac Systems, Inc.) with the following settings: gain 2000, mode R wave, 35HzLPN on, high-pass filter 0.5 Hz. Sampling was at 1000 Hz. Recordings were downsampled to 100 Hz in order to decrease file size, and data were exported from the Acqknowledge software as text files. Heart rate was derived from raw curves by a peak finding algorithm in R. Estimated heart rate of &lt;40 or &gt;200 beats per minutes was rejected (0.2% of data). For each event, heart rate was normalised to the 2 seconds preceding regulation instruction onset and averaged over a time window from 3 to 5 seconds from regulation instruction onset. The time window for analysis was chosen based on inspection of data.</p>

                <title>Rating scales</title>
                <p>The interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) has four subscales which measure different dimensions of trait empathy: empathic concern (EC), perspective taking (PT), personal distress (PD) and fantasy (FS) [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The IRI has been validated in a Swedish context [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], although the four-factor structure could not be replicated. Instead, EC formed one factor and PT, PD and FS together formed another factor. For this reason, we have not analysed differences between IRI subscales.</p>
                <p>The state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) has a state and a trait subscale [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We used a non-validated Swedish translation with which we have considerable experience, and which can be found in [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The state subscale (S) was administered before the experiment, and then again at the end of the experiment.</p>
                <p>The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) measures alexithymia, a construct thought to represent difficulties in identifying and describing one’s own emotions. It has three subscales: difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty describing feelings and externally oriented thinking [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We analysed only total scores. The scale has been validated in Swedish [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
                <p>The psychopathy personality inventory-revised (PPI-R) assesses psychopathic traits [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It contains eight content scales, which have been organized into a two-factor structure, encompassing the factors fearless dominance (FD; reflecting social poise, fearlessness and stress immunity) and self-centred impulsivity (SCI; reflecting impulsivity, irresponsibility and egocentricity). It also contains a subscale particularly reflecting lack of empathy (coldheartedness, C), which typically does not load highly on either factor. The Swedish version of the PPI-R has been validated based partly on the data collected in this study [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

In order to preserve anonymity, participants’ ages and educational backgrounds have been omitted from the published dataset. All analyses were made with R [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], using the packages <bold>RCurl</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to read data from GitHub, <bold>quantmod</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to find EKG R wave peaks, <bold>nlme</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to build mixed-effects models, <bold>effects</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to get confidence intervals on estimates, and <bold>RColorBrewer</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] for graphing. Mixed-effects models have been used throughout unless otherwise indicated. Effects were deviation coded, meaning that reported effect sizes refer to the difference from the grand mean. For instance, the effect of upregulation refers to whether participants were instructed to upregulate or downregulate, and the reported effect size is the difference between the upregulate condition and the mean of the upregulate and downregulate conditions.</p>
                <p>To investigate interaction effects of self-rated personality traits with stimulus valence and reappraisal instruction, a separate regression model was run with each rating scale, in which interactions between the scale score and valence and reappraisal instruction, respectively, were specified. Scale scores were <italic>z</italic>-transformed to yield standardized regression coefficients.</p>
                <p>A threshold of <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05 for statistical significance was used because this threshold is conventional in the field.</p>

                <title>Associations between self-rated personality traits to responses to stimuli and instructions to perform reappraisal</title>
                <p>We performed exploratory analyses of associations between self-rated personality traits and rated unpleasantness of negative vs neutral images (stimulus valence) as well as instruction to upregulate vs downregulate (instruction). The corresponding statistics can be found in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0249065.g009">Fig 9</xref>). For stimulus valence, we found that empathy subscales IRI-EC, IRI-PT, and IRI-F were associated with higher rated unpleasantness to negative-valence images, as expected. Conversely, empathy subscale IRI-PD was associated to lower rated unpleasantness, contrary to our expectations. All three subscales of the psychopathy personality inventory-revised (PPI-R) were associated with lower rated unpleasantness to negative-valence images, as expected. For physiological measures, the only notable associations between personality traits and stimulus valence was that PPI-R-C (coldheartedness) was associated with higher corrugator activity and lower heart rate in response to negative images.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we examined the effect of 25 mg oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal. We found that upregulation of negative-valence images caused increased unpleasantness ratings, corrugator activity, and heart rate compared to downregulation, confirming the validity of the paradigm. Oxazepam caused lower ratings of unpleasantness to negative stimuli, but no interaction between oxazepam and reappraisal was observed.</p>
              <p>As we have previously described in a report on the empathy for pain paradigm using the full sample of this experiment, [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], efficacy of drug effects was verified by longer response times and lower rated anxiety after the experiment in the oxazepam group. As noted above, upregulation of negative-valence images caused increased unpleasantness ratings, corrugator activity, and heart rate. Upregulation to both negative- and neutral-valence images also caused increased skin conductance responses. These findings confirm that the experimental paradigm was effective and that the drug reached a biological effect in the oxazepam group, providing an appropriate setting to test the effect of oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal. Ratings of unpleasantness may be affected by demand effects. As argued by Ray et al. [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], it is more convincing to measure both self-report and autonomic indices of emotional responses in reappraisal experiments, since they are sensitive to partly different sets of biases. In particular, autonomic responses are likely to be less affected by demand characteristics. In line with this reasoning, our finding that upregulation by cognitive reappraisal was associated with increased skin conductance responses further supports the validity of the paradigm, and is consistent with earlier findings [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Oxazepam caused lower ratings of unpleasantness to negative stimuli, but did not show any noteworthy interaction with cognitive reappraisal on any of our outcomes, contrary to the main hypothesis. These results indicate that 25 mg oxazepam does not have a major effect on cognitive reappraisal. However, the effect on emotional stimuli (without regulation) indicates that oxazepam modulates the affective experience of negative stimuli. This finding is consistent with an earlier finding from our group, where i.v. midazolam reduced perceived unpleasantness of negative-valence IAPS images [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It has been suggested that this effect could be caused by a general decrease in anxiety due to inhibited amygdala-dependent emotional processing [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the same physiological measurements were not used, our results contrast somewhat with previous reports that 20 mg oxazepam did not modulate affective ratings or event-related potentials in response to emotional stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and that neither 15 nor 30 mg oxazepam affected the fear-potentiated startle response [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our results are however consistent with a finding that 0.25 and 1 mg alprazolam inhibited startle responses to emotional stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
              <p>Cognitive reappraisal works through reappraising emotional stimuli in different ways. Functional imaging studies have shown that dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbitofrontal cortices are specifically involved in these processes [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has also been shown that these prefrontal processes interact with processing of emotional information in brain regions such as the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Since we showed effects of cognitive reappraisal on affective ratings and physiological measures but no interaction with benzodiazepines our data suggests that these regulatory processes do not interact but work in parallel. Therefore, our data do not corroborate the prediction that top-down regulatory mechanisms are suppressed by benzodiazepines, arising from the disinhibition theory of criminal violent behavior as suggested by [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The findings also do not suggest that benzodiazepines, although they have other risks in a clinical setting, contribute to poorer cognitive reappraisal in patients, as might have been expected from the observation that areas in the prefrontal cortex that are involved in emotional regulation also have high concentrations of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>Associations between on the one hand self-rated empathy, anxiety, alexithymia, psychopathy, and on the other hand cognitive reappraisal, have not been widely investigated. Exploratory analyses in our data showed that self-rated trait empathy measures were associated with stronger responses to negative-valence stimuli (except for personal distress that had the opposite result), whereas self-rated psychopathic traits were associated with weaker responses to negative-valence stimuli. Less consistent effects were observed in relation to instructions. One study has investigated the association of alexithymia to event-related potentials (ERP:s) during cognitive reappraisal, and found that higher alexithymia in a sample of healthy humans was associated with smaller ERP:s [<xref rid="pone.0249065.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The strongest associations between rating scales and experimental outcomes were observed for self-rated unpleasantness. This may be explained by the similar nature between these self-rated measures, as opposed to physiological measures.</p>
              <p>The generalizability of our results is limited by the nature of the sample, consisting of only male participants, most with ongoing or completed university education. This sample is not likely to be representative of benzodiazepine-prescribed patient groups nor recreational users. A further limitation concerns nature of the stimuli, which are a subset of all possible stimuli which could be used to induce emotion. The limited size of the sample, particularly the placebo group, precludes strong conclusions, and as with all randomised experiments, the possibility cannot be ruled out that baseline imbalances may influence the result, though we had no strong <italic>a priori</italic> reason to stratify randomisation to avoid imbalance on some particular variable. Furthermore, the choice of time windows for analyses of physiological signals is based on the observed data, which may introduce bias. Further work should use independent samples to define time windows of interest and to test hypotheses. It is also an open question whether different results would be seen with a higher dose of oxazepam or with another benzodiazepine.</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors implemented most of my previous suggestions in this revision, which has improved the derivation of research questions, description of the study paradigm, and discussions of findings as well as limitations. A few minor issues need to be resolved before publication however.</p>
              <p>General: In keeping with general terminology in the manuscript and to avoid confusion, “emotional reappraisal” should be changed to “cognitive reappraisal” throughout the manuscript (see abstract, conclusions, etc.)</p>
              <p>Materials and Methods, participants: Since PLoS One is a multidisciplinary journal and not all readers may be familiar with substance interactions, please add a short statement as to why participants could not be habitual consumers of nicotine. Are there interactions of oxazepam to be expected?</p>
              <p>Results: The authors adopted the results section according to my previous comments (variable naming), but did not add information as to whether an effect is statistically significant or not. However, I am of the opinion that it would greatly increase comprehensibility on part of the readers to respectively state before reporting effects and p-values whether an effect/interaction was significant or not. Example for unpleasantness ratings: “The three-way interaction was not significant at -2.7….”. This should be changed for all effects and interactions before I recommend publication. Additionally, for skin conductance, main effect of up-regulation and corrugator activity, main effect of negative stimulus valence, the authors should give a short description of the effect instead of simply stating “… as expected”.</p>
              <p>Associations between self-rated personality traits (p. 8): Please add that corresponding statistics can be found in Figure 9, as this is not immediately evident.</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>p.9: the sentence “It has also been shown that these prefrontal processes interact with processing of emotional information in brain regions such as the amygdala” is missing references.</p>
              <p>p.9: the sentence “The findings also do not suggest that benzodiazepines […] contribute to poorer emotion regulation performance in patients” needs to be amended.</p>
              <p>First, the authors did not directly assess emotion regulation performance, which would require objective analysis of number of reappraisal ideas and quality of ideas (see Papousek et al., 2017; Brain Imaging or Behavior, or Rowlands et al., 2019; Neuropsychological Rehabilitation). Much rather, reappraisal of IAPS pictures assesses individuals’ regulation success or reappraisal effectiveness in terms of differences in emotion intensity and physiological variables between two conditions (regulate up/down, etc.). Next, generalizing this study’s findings to “emotion regulation” in general does not seem justified, since only cognitive reappraisal was investigated. For these reasons, this sentence should read “The findings also do not suggest that benzodiazepines […] contribute to poorer cognitive reappraisal in patients.”</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Introduction</p>
              <p>1. The authors should draw some stronger connections between the GABAa receptors and frontal lobe activity to help solidify the logic behind by cognitive reappraisal would be impacted by benzodiazepines. Within the final paragraph on page one, the authors suggest this connection, but it could use some stronger connections.</p>
              <p>2. The authors present aims related to correlations/associations between measures, yet have a set of analyses related to physiological measures involving higher order cause and effect conclusion that can be made. Results should correspond to the predictions made in the aims section.</p>
              <p>Method</p>
              <p>1. Given that only males were used, the ability to generalize these results is rather limited. Moreover the population of individuals who would take benzodiazepines would likely show the greatest benefit and likely different results for any type of down regulation of emotion as compared to a “normal” sample.</p>
              <p>2. What was the average valance and arousal for the sets of IAPS images that were used?</p>
              <p>3. How long was each picture shown for? How long did the rating scale appear on the screen for? The authors mention they used 2 second time windows, but it isn’t clear if the stimuli were presented for only 2 seconds or longer.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>a. Much of the results section reported results that were not significant. There were a few interaction effects that were typical and expected.</p>
              <p>b. The final sample size is reported to be 22, but the table for the placebo condition it appears to say that only 13 participants were in the placebo condition, giving the treatment condition significantly more participants. This could account for a lack of findings in many areas.</p>
              <p>c. Corrugator activity shows expected increases with unpleasant stimuli in the upregulation condition, but no impact it appears of the treatment. Moreover, any of the results that are main effects should only be reported and not interpreted if there is a significant interaction within that set of analyses (e.g. the corrugator activity analyses).</p>
              <p>d. The majority of the analyses reported appear to have only correlations.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>The analyses that should have resulted in some of the main conclusions about this study appear to be pushed aside as a mere checks and balances set of analyses. The conclusions that are made about the impact of oxazepam appear to impact the subjective emotional experience but not the physiological experience. That is, the results indeed suggest that the participants may interpret that they should feel a particular way without effectively performing the task.</p>
              <p>3. The timecourse of cognitive reappraisal is an important thing to note here. Cognitive reappraisal does not unfold over the course of 2 seconds and the measures that the authors are using rely on autonomic nervous system changes. That is, from an EEG perspective the timecourse of changing brain activity as a result of the cognitive reappraisal task is indeed valid; however, the timecourse to change peripheral physiological responses may differ greatly. This leads back to my question within the method related to how long the stimuli were presented for. It is likely the case that if there was a longer timeframe that the physiological measures were captured there may have been changes late in the stimulus presentation for ECG and skin conductance.</p>

              <p>General: In keeping with general terminology in the manuscript and to avoid confusion, “emotional reappraisal” should be changed to “cognitive reappraisal” throughout the manuscript (see abstract, conclusions, etc.)</p>
              <p>This has been changed throughout.</p>
              <p>Materials and Methods, participants: Since PLoS One is a multidisciplinary journal and not all readers may be familiar with substance interactions, please add a short statement as to why participants could not be habitual consumers of nicotine. Are there interactions of oxazepam to be expected?</p>
              <p>We excluded habitual consumers of nicotine to reduce the risk of abstinence symptoms during the experiment. We have now added this into the methods section (page 3, “Participants”).</p>
              <p>Results: The authors adopted the results section according to my previous comments (variable naming), but did not add information as to whether an effect is statistically significant or not. However, I am of the opinion that it would greatly increase comprehensibility on part of the readers to respectively state before reporting effects and p-values whether an effect/interaction was significant or not. Example for unpleasantness ratings: “The three-way interaction was not significant at -2.7….”. This should be changed for all effects and interactions before I recommend publication. Additionally, for skin conductance, main effect of up-regulation and corrugator activity, main effect of negative stimulus valence, the authors should give a short description of the effect instead of simply stating “… as expected”.</p>
              <p>This has been changed throughout.</p>
              <p>Associations between self-rated personality traits (p. 8): Please add that corresponding statistics can be found in Figure 9, as this is not immediately evident.</p>
              <p>This has been added (page 8, “Associations between self-rated personality traits to responses to stimuli and instructions to perform reappraisal”).</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>p.9: the sentence “It has also been shown that these prefrontal processes interact with processing of emotional information in brain regions such as the amygdala” is missing references.</p>
              <p>We have added references as requested.</p>
              <p>p.9: the sentence “The findings also do not suggest that benzodiazepines […] contribute to poorer emotion regulation performance in patients” needs to be amended.</p>
              <p>First, the authors did not directly assess emotion regulation performance, which would require objective analysis of number of reappraisal ideas and quality of ideas (see Papousek et al., 2017; Brain Imaging or Behavior, or Rowlands et al., 2019; Neuropsychological Rehabilitation). Much rather, reappraisal of IAPS pictures assesses individuals’ regulation success or reappraisal effectiveness in terms of differences in emotion intensity and physiological variables between two conditions (regulate up/down, etc.). Next, generalizing this study’s findings to “emotion regulation” in general does not seem justified, since only cognitive reappraisal was investigated. For these reasons, this sentence should read “The findings also do not suggest that benzodiazepines […] contribute to poorer cognitive reappraisal in patients.”</p>
              <p>This has been edited as suggested.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Introduction</p>
              <p>1. The authors should draw some stronger connections between the GABAa receptors and frontal lobe activity to help solidify the logic behind by cognitive reappraisal would be impacted by benzodiazepines. Within the final paragraph on page one, the authors suggest this connection, but it could use some stronger connections.</p>
              <p>We have added text to the introduction and discussion to strenghten this connection in light of PET evidence of high concentrations of GABAA receptors in areas of the prefrontal cortex related to emotional processing (page 2, end of 2nd paragraph, and page 9, 4th paragraph of discussion).</p>
              <p>2. The authors present aims related to correlations/associations between measures, yet have a set of analyses related to physiological measures involving higher order cause and effect conclusion that can be made. Results should correspond to the predictions made in the aims section.</p>
              <p>We have again reviewed the aims and results for consistency. The main aim was to investigate effects of benzodiazepines, whereas design factors of the experimental paradigm are assumed to have intended effects, e.g. higher unpleasantness to negative compared to neutral images. Validation of the paradigm was not an aim of this study.</p>
              <p>Method</p>
              <p>1. Given that only males were used, the ability to generalize these results is rather limited. Moreover the population of individuals who would take benzodiazepines would likely show the greatest benefit and likely different results for any type of down regulation of emotion as compared to a “normal” sample.</p>
              <p>These important limitations are noted in the discussion (last paragraph).</p>
              <p>2. What was the average valance and arousal for the sets of IAPS images that were used?</p>
              <p>This has been added under Stimuli and Experimental Paradigm.</p>
              <p>3. How long was each picture shown for? How long did the rating scale appear on the screen for? The authors mention they used 2 second time windows, but it isn’t clear if the stimuli were presented for only 2 seconds or longer.</p>
              <p>We have added this information in the methods section (“Stimuli and experimental paradigm”), please see also figure 1.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>a. Much of the results section reported results that were not significant. There were a few interaction effects that were typical and expected.</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer’s observation.</p>
              <p>b. The final sample size is reported to be 22, but the table for the placebo condition it appears to say that only 13 participants were in the placebo condition, giving the treatment condition significantly more participants. This could account for a lack of findings in many areas.</p>
              <p>We agree that this is indeed the case, and we discuss this limitation in the discussion section (last paragraph).</p>
              <p>c. Corrugator activity shows expected increases with unpleasant stimuli in the upregulation condition, but no impact it appears of the treatment. Moreover, any of the results that are main effects should only be reported and not interpreted if there is a significant interaction within that set of analyses (e.g. the corrugator activity analyses).</p>
              <p>We have removed interpretations of main effects in the presence of interaction effects throughout the results section.</p>
              <p>d. The majority of the analyses reported appear to have only correlations.</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer’s observation.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>The analyses that should have resulted in some of the main conclusions about this study appear to be pushed aside as a mere checks and balances set of analyses. The conclusions that are made about the impact of oxazepam appear to impact the subjective emotional experience but not the physiological experience. That is, the results indeed suggest that the participants may interpret that they should feel a particular way without effectively performing the task.</p>
              <p>We agree that effects of oxazepam are evident in self-rated unpleasantness but not in physiological outcomes. The reviewer suggests that this may be due to demand effects. We discuss this possibility in the manuscript (discussion, 2nd paragraph). </p>
              <p>While we appreciate that the reviewer wishes to further highlight significant effects of the paradigm, this study did not aim to test the validity of the experimental paradigm, which is based on previous research as described in the introduction. </p>
              <p>3. The timecourse of cognitive reappraisal is an important thing to note here. Cognitive reappraisal does not unfold over the course of 2 seconds and the measures that the authors are using rely on autonomic nervous system changes. That is, from an EEG perspective the timecourse of changing brain activity as a result of the cognitive reappraisal task is indeed valid; however, the timecourse to change peripheral physiological responses may differ greatly. This leads back to my question within the method related to how long the stimuli were presented for. It is likely the case that if there was a longer timeframe that the physiological measures were captured there may have been changes late in the stimulus presentation for ECG and skin conductance.</p>
              <p>Effects were measured up to 6 seconds; please see figures 3, 5, and 7.</p>
