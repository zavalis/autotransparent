                <p>To learn from feedback (trial and error) is essential for all species. Insufficient sleep has been found to reduce the sensitivity to feedback as well as increase reward sensitivity. To determine whether insufficient sleep alters learning from positive and negative feedback, healthy participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>¬†=¬†32, mean age 29.0¬†years, 18 women) were tested once after normal sleep (8¬†hr time in bed for 2¬†nights) and once after 2¬†nights of sleep restriction (4¬†hr/night) on a probabilistic selection task where learning behaviour was evaluated in three ways: as generalised learning, short‚Äêterm win‚Äìstay/lose‚Äìshift learning strategies, and trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial learning rate. Sleep restriction did not alter the sensitivity to either positive or negative feedback on generalised learning. Also, short‚Äêterm win‚Äìstay/lose‚Äìshift strategies were not affected by sleep restriction. Similarly, results from computational models that assess the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial update of stimuli value demonstrated no difference between sleep conditions after the first block. However, a slower learning rate from negative feedback when evaluating all learning blocks was found after sleep restriction. Despite a marked increase in sleepiness and slowed learning rate for negative feedback, sleep restriction did not appear to alter strategies and generalisation of learning from positive or negative feedback.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Reinforcement learning is how we learn from positive (reward) or negative (punishment) feedback and adapt behaviour to maximise reward (Sutton &amp; Barto,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Stemming from early animal behavioural studies, including Ivan Pavlov‚Äôs salivating dogs (Todes,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) and Thorndike‚Äôs law of effect (Thorndike,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">1911</xref>), reinforcement learning is now being applied to machine learning and neural signalling (Sutton &amp; Barto,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Sleep loss has previously been found to affect the response to feedback (Liu &amp; Zhou,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Whitney et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, whether sleep loss affects the incentives to learn from positive or negative feedback has not yet been explored.</p>
              <p>The detrimental effects on a range of cognitive functions, including attention and working memory, are well documented for total sleep deprivation (Lim &amp; Dinges,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Pilcher &amp; Huffcutt,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), but also for shorter periods of sleep restriction (van Dongen et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Lowe et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Attentional degradation after sleep loss may in turn cause deficits in item and associative recognition memory (Ratcliff &amp; Van Dongen,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Sleep deprivation increases reward‚Äêseeking tendencies (Venkatraman et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and causes an over‚Äêactivation in the reward‚Äêrelated neural circuitries in response to gamble wins (Mullin et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Venkatraman et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), positive images (Gujar et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and food desirability (Greer et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; St‚ÄêOnge et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), compared to normal night sleep. These reward‚Äêseeking tendencies may also be related to findings of attenuated risk‚Äêaversion after sleep loss (Killgore,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Maric et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, studies investigating the response to feedback have found reduced event‚Äêrelated potentials (ERP) amplitudes after 72¬†hr of sleep deprivation (Liu &amp; Zhou,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and attenuated skin conductance response after 62¬†hr of sleep deprivation (Whitney et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which in the latter study was associated with an ineffective use of feedback, although the authors did not investigate differences in response to feedback.</p>
              <p>One of the mechanisms behind a reward‚Äêseeking behaviour after total sleep deprivation can be traced to a reduced availability of D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> dopamine receptors (Volkow et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), which in turn increases the D<sub>1</sub> receptor activation, making sleep deprived individuals hypersensitive to reward (Krause et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Support of a direct link between dopamine availability and reinforcement learning (Garrison et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) has been found in experimental studies on patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, where patients <italic toggle="yes">on</italic> dopamine medication prioritised learning from positive feedback while patients <italic toggle="yes">off</italic> medication prioritised avoiding negative feedback (Frank,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), or had no specific preference (McCoy et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Moreover, reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q‚Äêlearning (Sutton &amp; Barto,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), providing a latent measure of the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial update of the stimuli value have shown that the change in learning rate speed is related to dopamine (McCoy et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Indirect evidence on the role of dopamine in reinforcement learning comes from studies on ageing, which leads to increased tendency to avoid negative feedback (Frank &amp; Kong,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and acute stress that can increase the tendency to learn from positive feedback (Lighthall et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) or reduce the tendency to learn from negative feedback (Petzold et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>The main aim of the present study was to determine whether 2¬†nights of sleep restriction affects the incentives to learn from positive or negative feedback using a probabilistic selection task (Frank,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). As there is a scarcity of studies on reward processing after sleep restriction, we rely on findings from total sleep deprivation studies and assume that if sleep restriction, similar to total sleep deprivation, increases the reward incentives (Krause et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), we would expect that the difference in the proportion of correct responses learned from positive compared to negative feedback would be greater following 2¬†nights of sleep restriction (~4¬†hr) than after 2¬†nights of normal sleep (~8¬†hr).</p>
              <p>We were mainly interested in the generalised reinforcement learning, that is, to what degree participants prioritised to choose the symbol associated with highest positive value (A) against more neutral symbols (C, D, E and F) or to avoid the symbol associated with the highest negative value (B) against more neutral symbols. As sleep loss has been found to affect attention and working memory (Lim &amp; Dinges,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lowe et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), we also investigated if the short‚Äêterm learning in the initial learning phase was biased towards positive or negative feedback, as shown in other contexts (Lighthall et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition, we used a computational Q‚Äêlearning algorithm to investigate the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial value update for the learning rate of positive and negative feedback during the learning phase (Frank et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; McCoy et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We measured sleepiness using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS; √Ökerstedt &amp; Gillberg,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) and subjective stress using a rating scale ranging from 1¬†=¬†very relaxed (‚ÄúV√§ldigt avsp√§nd‚Äù) to 9¬†=¬†extremely stressed (‚ÄúExtremt stressad‚Äù) (Schwarz et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>A total of 32 healthy individuals (18 women; mean [<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>] age¬†29.0¬†[7.6]¬†years), recruited from the greater Stockholm area, completed this study in a within‚Äêparticipant cross‚Äêover fashion. All participants were non‚Äêtobacco users (cigarettes and snus), moderate alcohol and coffee consumers (&lt;3 glasses of alcohol and &lt;6 cups of coffee per day), na√Øve to the Japanese language, not taking regular medication, not working night shifts, and had normal sleep habits with a habitual sleep requirement of between 7.0 and 9.0¬†hr. Participants demonstrated normal/corrected‚Äêto‚Äênormal visual and auditory acuity, had no physiological or psychiatric pathology that could affect sleep or any of the measured variables, and had not been travelling across more than two time zones during the previous month. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review board in Stockholm, Sweden (DNR: 2010/1506‚Äê31, 2016/64‚Äê32), and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion and received monetary compensation.</p>

                <title>Protocol</title>
                <p>Participants were informed about the protocol and performed a training version of the task during an initial screening session. The experimental task was then completed in two test sessions, once after 2 consecutive nights of sleep restriction and once after 2 consecutive nights of normal sleep, in a counterbalanced order with at least a 1‚Äêweek wash‚Äêout period of normal sleep between the conditions. Both test sessions took place at the same time of day, with a starting time between 12:30 and 15:00¬†hours, and began with a calm‚Äêdown period of 30¬†min during which participants completed questionnaires. Subsequently, each participant underwent five to six computerised experimental tasks. The tasks were always presented in the same order, each lasting between 10 and 40¬†min, with the opportunity to take short breaks in between. After each experimental task, participants completed a short questionnaire about sleepiness and motivation during the just completed task.</p>
                <p>In the sleep restriction condition, participants were given a 4‚Äêhr sleep opportunity, the exact timing being self‚Äêchosen between 01:00¬†hours ¬±¬†1¬†hr and 05:00¬†hours ¬±¬†1¬†hr. In the normal sleep condition, participants were instructed to make sure to get 7‚Äì8¬†hr time in bed between 23:00¬†hours ¬±¬†1¬†hr and 07:00¬†hours ¬±¬†1¬†hr. Both conditions were performed in their homes. Adherence to the protocol was controlled with an actiograph, a wrist‚Äêworn movement sensitive device commonly used to measure sleep‚Äìwake activity (Actiwatch, Cambridge Neuro‚ÄêTechnology Ltd.). Participants were additionally instructed to send a text message to the experimenter shortly before going to sleep and shortly after having woken up. In the morning after each experimental night (2¬†nights of sleep restriction, 2¬†nights of normal sleep), participants completed a sleep diary, providing information about sleep times, sleep quality, and the feeling of sleepiness in the morning. Napping, hard physical training, as well as consuming caffeine or alcohol was not permitted 2¬†days before and the day of the test session.

                <title>Probabilistic selection task</title>
                <p>To test reinforcement learning, we used a probabilistic selection task (Frank,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This task consists of a learning phase and a test phase. In the learning phase participants learn from feedback to choose the most likely winner in a pair of ambiguous symbols. Three pairs (A/B, C/D, E/F, see Figure¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) of Japanese Hiragana symbols were presented in a pseudorandomised order on the left and right of the centre of the screen (balanced). Within each pair one symbol was more likely to be the winning symbol, which is to render positive feedback (for the pair A/B the ratio was 80/20, for C/D 70/30 and for E/F 60/40). Each trial (Figure¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) started with a short inter‚Äêtrial interval (250¬†ms) after which the symbols appeared until a response was given or 4,000¬†ms had passed, in which case the participant was informed that the response was missed. Responses were made by pressing on a keyboard, <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> for the left symbol or <italic toggle="yes">L</italic> for the right symbol and participants were instructed to answer as fast and correctly as possible. Following a response, positive feedback was given as green text stating the Swedish word for ‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù (R√§tt) combined with a sound with ascending pitch, and negative feedback was given as red text stating the Swedish word for ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù (Fel) combined with a sound with a descending pitch. A block consisted of 60 trials where each of the three pairs of symbols was presented 20 times, with balanced lateralisation within the pairs. The learning phase was finished after a block when the participant had reached the learning criteria for all pairs (‚â•65% A choices for A/B trials, ‚â•60% C choices for C/D trials, and ‚â•40% E choices for E/F trials), or reached a maximum of six blocks. In addition, we used a training version of the task at screening, with a different set of characters and more deterministic probabilities, but higher learning criteria. This was done mainly to facilitate the understanding of the task, and to avoid the possibility that sleep restriction would impair the ability to understand the task instructions. Thus, in total three sets of Japanese characters were used. Note that the data from the screening were not included in the analysis. The experiment was designed using Inquisit 4 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.millisecond.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.millisecond.com</ext-link>).</p>

                <p>During the test phase, the symbols were mixed, making up 15 combinations that were presented four times, rendering a total of 60 trials. A trial was the same as in the learning phase but without feedback. This phase assesses the ability to generalise. Positive feedback learning is characterised by a higher accuracy for the symbol with highest probability in the learning phase (symbol A) when paired with one of the more neutral stimuli (C, D, E or F) and negative feedback learning by higher accuracy for avoiding the symbol with the lowest probability (symbol B) when paired with the neutral stimuli. Due to the repeated measures design, two different sets of Japanese characters were used and order was counterbalanced between participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>For all analyses, we used Bayesian generalised linear mixed‚Äêeffects models (GLMM) fitted in R (R Core Team,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Mixed‚Äêeffects models are in general preferable to single‚Äêlevel analyses, but especially on repeated measures (McElreath,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A Bayesian approach to the GLMM provides rich information in the full posterior distribution, as compared to point estimates, and allows evaluation of the null hypothesis (Kruschke &amp; Liddell,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Behavioural analyses</title>
                  <p>For all behavioural analyses we used weakly informative priors with a Student‚Äôs <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> distribution (<italic toggle="yes">df</italic>¬†=¬†3, ¬µ¬†=¬†0, œÉ¬†=¬†2.5) on the intercept and slope. A Cauchy prior (location¬†=¬†0, scale¬†=¬†1) was used on the standard deviations (<italic toggle="yes">SDs</italic>). Posterior predictive checks were performed to ensure sufficient model requirements. From the posterior distributions we calculated the highest maximum a posteriori probability estimate (MAP), or the mode of the posterior distribution, and 95% highest density intervals (HDI) for each parameter. However, for best understanding of the data and not merely its summary statistics, readers are encouraged to study the full posterior distribution. A region of practical equivalence (ROPE) was used as proxy for the null hypothesis, with limits set to reflect half of a small effect size (Kruschke,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). We also estimated Bayes factors, by taking the likelihood ratios of the posterior distribution falling within or outside the ROPE over the prior distribution (null) falling within or outside the ROPE (Makowski et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The Bayes factors denote the evidence of the experimental hypothesis over the null hypothesis (BF<sub>10</sub>) or reversed (BF<sub>01</sub>). A BF<sub>10</sub> &gt;1 or BF<sub>01</sub> &lt;1 indicates evidence for the experimental and BF<sub>10</sub> &lt;1 or BF<sub>01</sub> &gt;1 indicates evidence for the null hypothesis, with level of evidence considered moderate if above 3 or below 1/3, strong if above 10 or below 1/10, and extreme if above 100 or below 1/100 (Beard et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Computational model</title>
                  <p>For the computational model we used a Q‚Äêlearning algorithm, which estimates the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial expected value update based on the feedback given (Sutton &amp; Barto,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The analytic procedure were based on that of McCoy et¬†al.,¬†(<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and we adapted the scripts to model sleep as a within subject parameter (scripts available on <ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/mtszr/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/mtszr/</ext-link>). The outcome parameters consisted of two learning rates (Œ±), for positive and negative feedback respectively, and inverse temperature (Œ≤) reflecting the consistency in the choices. Weakly informative normally distributed priors (¬µ¬†=¬†0, œÉ¬†=¬†1) were set on the group level and individual level means and half‚ÄêCauchy priors (location¬†=¬†0, scale¬†=¬†5) were set on the group level <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>s. Q‚Äêvalues were initialised at 0.5. Parameters were transformed to an inverse probit distribution and centred on zero with a <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> of 1 and with restrictive boundaries of ¬±¬†5 (see Ahn et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We fitted one model with data from all learning blocks and one with data from the first learning block only. For evaluative purposes, we also fitted models with a single learning rate parameter (positive and negative combined), although they did not provide a better fit than the models with two learning rate parameters evaluated by leave‚Äêone‚Äêout cross validation (LOO; Vehtari et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (see Table¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>).</p>

                <p>To investigate short‚Äêterm learning, we calculated the proportion of trials where the choice was to select the same symbol that rendered positive feedback on the previous trial (win‚Äìstay) and the proportion of trials where the choice was to switch when given negative feedback (lose‚Äìshift).

                <p>In the test phase, we investigated how the participants had generalised the learning from the learning phase. We were specifically interested in whether learning was prioritised for positive or negative feedback. Positive feedback learning is indicated by the proportion of choices of the symbol with highest probability to win (A) over the more neutral symbols (C, D, E, F) and negative feedback learning is indicated by the proportion where the choice was not to select the symbol with least probability to win (B) when paired with the more neutral symbols. Here we also did not observe any differences between sleep conditions in the accuracy for positive (MAP¬†=¬†0.0, 95% HDI¬†=¬†‚àí0.10 to 0.11, BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†0.13, BF<sub>01</sub>¬†=¬†7.54) or negative (MAP¬†=¬†‚àí0.02, 95% HDI¬†=¬†‚àí0.12 to 0.10, BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†0.11, BF<sub>01</sub>¬†=¬†9.39) feedback learning. Instead, our data are favour the null hypothesis, that learned associations are practically equal for both positive and negative feedback after sleep restriction compared to normal sleep (Figure¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Collapsing over sleep conditions there was no difference in learning accuracy between positive and negative feedback (MAP¬†=¬†0.07, 95% HDI¬†=¬†‚àí0.01 to 0.14, BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†0.26, BF<sub>01</sub>¬†=¬†3.87).</p>

However, when considering all learning blocks, there was strong evidence for slower learning after sleep restriction (MAP¬†=¬†‚àí1.65, 95% HDI¬†=¬†‚àí3.63 to ‚àí0.56, BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†82.44, BF<sub>01</sub>¬†=¬†0.01). To further assess the influence of sleep restriction on positive and negative learning rate, we first calculated the difference in posterior distributions between the positive and the negative learning rate (Positive‚ÄìNegative) stratified by sleep condition. Then we calculated the differences of these differences to estimate whether sleep restriction affects positive and negative learning rate differentially. Results showed inconclusive evidence both for the data from the first block (MAP¬†=¬†0.95, 95% HDI¬†=¬†‚àí0.49 to 2.38, BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†1.88, BF<sub>01</sub>¬†=¬†0.53) and for the data from all blocks (MAP¬†=¬†0.15, 95% HDI¬†=¬†‚àí2.27 to 1.61, BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†0.88, BF<sub>01</sub>¬†=¬†1.14).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In the present study, 2¬†nights of sleep restriction increased sleepiness, but did not affect generalised learning in the test phase of the reinforcement learning task. Utilising Bayesian statistics with Bayes factors showing the probability of one hypothesis over the other, we found that the data favoured the null hypothesis, indicating that participants in both sleep conditions learned equally well from positive and negative feedback. There was no support for sleep restriction having an effect on the neither the win‚Äìstay nor lose‚Äìshift learning strategies over the first 60 trials of the learning phase. Complementary computational modelling using a Q‚Äêlearning algorithm further suggested that learning rate, estimated from the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial behaviour in the first block of the learning phase did not differ between sleep conditions. However, when evaluating all learning phase blocks, there was strong evidence of slowed learning rate for negative feedback after sleep restriction.</p>
              <p>We did not observe alterations in generalised learning or win‚Äìstay/lose‚Äìshift tendencies after sleep restriction, as indicated by the null hypothesis being between seven and &gt;100 times more likely than the experimental hypothesis. Most of the previous research is based on total sleep deprivation (Liu &amp; Zhou,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Whitney et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and it is possible that 2¬†nights of sleep restriction did not have the same effect on reward incentives. It has been hypothesised that adenosine accumulation is involved in the dopamine alterations (Krause et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and this accumulation could possibly have been restored enough from the, although short, sleep period (Elmenhorst et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Another reason for the lack of effect of sleep restriction on reinforcement learning could be that the probabilistic selection task was not sensitive enough to capture such changes after sleep restriction. On the other hand, other studies using a similar assumption regarding dopamine availability, such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease (Frank,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Frank et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; McCoy et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and stress (Lighthall et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Petzold et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and the same reinforcement learning task, have found an effect on generalised learning. Although the probabilistic selection task is a well‚Äêestablished paradigm, the feedback may not have triggered a hedonic reward signal comparable to those of economic, food or pleasurable images used in previous sleep deprivation studies (Greer et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Gujar et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mullin et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Venkatraman et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Thus, the reward in our paradigm was potentially too weak or not valued relevant enough to cause detectable behavioural changes after sleep restriction. An avenue for further studies is to investigate the effect of total sleep deprivation on reinforcement learning, possibly combined with more ecologically valid or stronger reinforcers in relation to sleep loss.</p>
              <p>The results from the computational model suggest that the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial negative learning rate is affected by sleep restriction when evaluating the full learning phase, but not when only evaluating data from the first block. The win‚Äìstay and lose‚Äìshift reflected the total proportions of respective behaviour for the first learning phase block, and only considered the response of the previous trial. The Q‚Äêlearning estimates, on the other hand, was based on the trial‚Äêby‚Äêtrial value update that considers the continuous learning from all previous feedback. For the first block, the results were somewhat in agreement with the win‚Äìstay and lose‚Äìshift results, although there is uncertainty in the effect of sleep restriction for learning rate from negative feedback. For the data from the full learning phase, we observed a slowing of learning rate after sleep restriction for negative feedback, and a slight slowing for positive feedback that was not confidently supported by the Bayes factor (BF<sub>10</sub>¬†=¬†2.66). Thus, rather than the hypothesised increase in reward seeking, we observed a slowing of learning speed from negative feedback after sleep restriction that could be related to increased risk‚Äêseeking behaviour found after sleep restriction (Killgore,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Maric et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q‚Äêlearning, have been directly linked to dopamine activity (Garrison et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Total sleep deprivation has been associated with downregulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor availability (Volkow et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and lower D<sub>2</sub> receptor availability has been linked to slower learning rate specifically for negative feedback (Frank et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Slowing in learning rate could indicate problems in maintaining feedback information in working memory and slower integration of information over time (Frank et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Sleep restriction caused a slower learning rate for negative feedback, but to some degree also affected the learning rate for positive feedback. Moreover, high uncertainty in the difference estimates between positive and negative learning rate between the two sleep conditions did not confidently favour one hypothesis over the other. This could be an indication of a general working memory decline or attention deficits commonly found after sleep restriction (Lowe et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) rather than being associated to specific feedback valence. Lastly, sleep restriction did not affect the inverse temperature (Œ≤), indicating that the level of consistency in choice behaviour was similar across conditions.</p>
              <p>To limit differences between individuals regarding time of task, we used a limit of six blocks for completing the learning phase, regardless of passing the learning criteria or not. After sleep restriction six out of the 32 participants did not reach the criteria within this limit compared to two out of the 32 after normal sleep, a difference with moderate support from the Bayes factor. This could be related to general attentional or working memory impairments after sleep restriction (van Dongen et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Lowe et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), but as this was not a main question of interest further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms for why sleep restriction may reduce the probability of reaching a learning criterion.</p>
              <p>There are some limitations in the present study worth mentioning. The sleep manipulation was done in the participants‚Äô homes restricting the possibilities of controlling adherence to the protocol. For the 2 manipulation nights, sleep was measured using actiography and sleep diaries. With a few exceptions, these data show satisfactory adherence to the sleep restriction protocol. For the other nights before and in‚Äêbetween the test sessions we did not measure sleep but relied on the participants keeping to their habitual sleeping pattern and following the instructions not to take naps during the day. However, we have little reason to believe that any divergence from these patterns would be other than random, therefore not changing the conclusions of the study. Finally, these results should be interpreted with the notion that 2¬†nights of sleep restriction may not be directly transferable to potential effects of total sleep deprivation. Sleep restriction may be a more ecologically valid form of sleep loss, and similar deficits have been found for executive functions and vigilant attention (van Dongen et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Lowe et¬†al.,¬†<xref rid="jsr13236-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), yet less is known about underlying reward incentives after sleep restriction.</p>
              <p>To conclude, 2¬†nights of sleep restriction did not affect the accuracy in generalised learning from positive or negative feedback, the win‚Äìstay/lose‚Äìshift tendencies, and the modelled learning rate in the initial learning phase. However, considering all blocks from the learning phase using a computational modelling approach revealed that sleep restriction causes a slower learning rate for negative feedback.</p>
