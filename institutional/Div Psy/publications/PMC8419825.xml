                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">IMPROVE aims to conduct a hybrid type 3 evaluation design to test the effectiveness of bundled implementation strategies on intervention fidelity of the Healthy School Start (HSS) program, while simultaneously monitoring effects on health outcomes of children and parents. The HSS is a 4-component family support program for children starting school (5–7 years of age) promoting healthy dietary habits and physical activity in the home environment to prevent childhood obesity and parents’ risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">IMPROVE is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with two arms to evaluate and compare the effects of two different bundles of implementation strategies on intervention fidelity expressed as adherence and responsiveness at 12 and 24 months (primary outcomes). Thirty schools in two municipalities will participate in the study reaching about 1400 families per school year. In stakeholder workshops, key implementation determinants were identified according to the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Through a consensus process with stakeholders, two bundles of implementation strategies were tailored to address context-specific determinants. Schools randomly assigned to group 1 will receive bundle 1 (Basic) and group 2 will receive bundle 1 + 2 (Enhanced). Bundle 2 consists of external facilitation, fidelity monitoring and feedback strategies. Secondary outcomes will include change in acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and organisational readiness as perceived by school staff. In addition, child weight status and diet, and parents’ feeding practices and risk of type 2 diabetes will be monitored. Linear and ordinal regression analysis will be used to test the effect on the primary and secondary outcomes, taking clustering and covariates into consideration where needed. Process evaluation will be conducted through key stakeholder interviews to investigate experiences of the program and perceptions on sustainability.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This systematic approach to investigating the effectiveness of two different bundles of implementation strategies tailored to context-specific determinants on the fidelity of the HSS intervention will provide new insight into feasible implementation strategies and external support needed for the HSS to be effective and sustainable. Results will help inform how to bridge the gap between the research on school-based health programs and routine practice in schools.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">An unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are among the most important risk factors for chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, different types of cancers and diabetes in Sweden and globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, these health behaviours increase the risk of overweight and obesity from early childhood and throughout the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More than half of the adult population in most high-income countries now is overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Previous studies from Sweden and other high-income countries have shown that children of parents with lower educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and non-Nordic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] have a higher consumption of unhealthy foods and also higher levels of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] than children of parents with higher educational attainment and who are Swedish-born. There is consistently a 2–3 fold lower prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in areas with higher socioeconomic status (i.e. income and education) compared to disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which is also found among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Given this, there is a need for interventions that start at an early age and target the whole family. Systematic reviews have concluded that due to accessibility to reach nearly all children in a given community, schools are an ideal setting for the delivery of health programs, particularly for children 6–12 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Effective school-based programs are characterised by active parental involvement, especially for younger children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Parents are key in shaping the food and meal environment, providing and reinforcing opportunities for physical activity, model healthy habits, and establish social and cultural norms that promote health for their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

                <title>Determinants of implementation and implementation strategies</title>
                <p id="Par23">In order for evidence-based programs to affect population health, they have to be implemented with high fidelity at scale and sustained over time, which has been difficult to achieve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], especially for more complex multi-level programs. One reason for this is that context-specific determinants of successful implementation are often not identified and used to inform the development of tailored implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a useful framework that can be used by implementation researchers with community partners to identify context-specific determinants potentially influencing implementation. It includes 39 constructs across five domains; the intervention itself, the inner setting, the outer setting, characteristics of providers, and the implementation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Three of the 39 constructs have repeatedly been shown to relate to implementation success, namely stakeholders’ perception of the advantage of the intervention relative to other programs, the tension for change as perceived by stakeholders, and if clients’ needs are prioritised by the organisation and resources are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other important constructs are relative priority and planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To accommodate the multi-level nature of interventions including both children and parents, a sixth domain in the CFIR has been proposed called “characteristics of intervention recipients” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A construct that has received increasing attention in the inner setting as an important factor for implementation success is the construct “Readiness for Implementation”, also called organizational readiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Organizational readiness is a determinant of successful adoption which is necessary for implementers to persist toward fidelity.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Developing implementation strategies that are tailored to context-specific implementation determinants is more likely to improve fidelity to the intervention than no strategies or simple dissemination of guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Determinants of implementation at both individual (provider and service recipient) and organisational levels should therefore be carefully identified as a first step, preferably in collaboration with key stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, it is not yet clear how best to tailor strategies and therefore not clear what the magnitude of the effect is that tailored implementation strategies have on both implementation and service recipient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Assessment of fidelity to the intervention components is one way of evaluating the effectiveness of tailored implementation strategies.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) Project has yielded a significant contribution to establish a common language and taxonomy of 73 unique implementation strategies in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Cook et al. adapted the ERIC taxonomy for use in the school context, with 75 unique implementation strategies from which to choose and tailor strategies to context-specific barriers, the SISTER taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recent study by Lyon et al. including 200 school-based consultants who support social, emotional, and mental health services found that the five strategies rated as most important were: (a) Conduct ongoing training, (b) Make training dynamic, (c) Provide ongoing consultation/coaching, (d) Monitor the progress of the implementation effort, and (e) Improve implementers’ buy-in. The five strategies rated as most feasible were (a) Make training dynamic, (b) Distribute educational materials, (c) Remind school personnel, (d) Facilitation/problem solving, and (e) Capture and share local knowledge. Using these types of implementation strategies in isolation as standalone approaches is not advised as there are numerous determinants influencing successful implementation. Rather, what is needed is a bundle of strategies that target different barriers within a given context to achieve high fidelity to and effectiveness of school-based interventions. Reporting on fidelity to the implementation strategies is equally as important to understand how and why successful implementation of the intervention comes about [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Strategies should be clearly described according to features such as a) the actor; b) the action; c) the action target; d) temporality; e) dose; f) implementation outcome affected; and g) the justification for use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

                <title>The Healthy School Start program</title>
                <p id="Par26">Development of the Healthy School Start program (HSS) began in 2010 and to date the program has been evaluated in three waves. It is based on Social Cognitive Theory with parental self-efficacy, role modelling, and observational learning as central constructs and mediators of child behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The program is designed to run in compulsory pre-school class or grade 1 (child age 5–7 years) and is universal (reaches all children). It can be characterised as a structured work routine to fulfil the requirements in the curriculum for teachers to teach about health. It is also fully in line with the Swedish national guidelines for school health care concerning health promotion and prevention of overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite the existence of these guidelines, no specific evidence-based practice is recommended. This results in inconsistencies in practice and negative parental responses are often encountered by school nurses when it comes to the issue of child weight development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">The program targets parents of children during a developmental period in which health-related behaviours are still very much under the influence of parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The program is delivered by teachers, school nurses and primary health care staff, and involves four core components: 1) A health information brochure to parents; 2) Motivational interviewing (MI) sessions with parents performed by the school nurse; 3) Classroom activities performed by teachers with home assignments to be completed by children together with their parents; and 4) a web-based self-test of type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk for parents with a recommendation to seek medical advice in primary health care, if needed. These four components were designed to be complementary and mutually reinforcing as emphasised by Gittelsohn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], who summarised challenges and lessons learnt from multi-level and multi-component interventions to prevent and reduce childhood obesity in different countries. In previous trials of the HSS program, the following implementation strategies used were used based on experience and the literature: 1) Obtain formal commitments, a written agreement with each school specifying school and researcher obligations; 2) Distribution of educational materials like the health brochure, information on the project website and video instructions for teachers; 3) Ongoing training, MI training for school nurses; and 4) Prepare families to be active participants through a kick-off meeting for school staff and parents together.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The program has been evaluated in schools with mixed socioeconomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and in disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] in the greater Stockholm area. Fidelity to the intervention components was high for the MI component performed by external MI counsellors in the first two trials, and the classroom component performed by teachers. In the first trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] we found significant beneficial effects on dietary habits (higher consumption of fruit and vegetables and lower consumption of unhealthy foods and drinks in the intervention group relative to control). In the second trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] we also found a significantly lower BMI z-score in children with obesity at baseline compared to control. In an attempt to increase the involvement of parents in the program, a validated short non-invasive tool to identify individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes (FINDRISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] was added to the third trial. Undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes are common in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. If detected early, lifestyle modification can reverse this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and potentially have beneficial effects on the whole family. In addition, an increased emphasis was placed on parental feeding practices and child physical activity, and the MI was conducted by trained school nurses in the third trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Results from the third trial running from 2017 to 2019 are in line with the previous studies (manuscript submitted).</p>
                <p id="Par29">During previous evaluations of the HSS program the following implementation barriers were encountered: low priority given to health promotion in schools relative to achievement of learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], lack of positive leadership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], lack of preparation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the need for clear communication and collaboration between teachers and parents, especially regarding the children’s home assignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and difficulty to engage parents in low-income areas due to stressful everyday life and lack of knowledge and parenting skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, it was found that commitment among staff is important for high intervention fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Addressing these barriers could be achieved through the establishment of an implementation team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and by receiving resources and support from external partners such as public health teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Ultimately, there are numerous barriers that impact the successful implementation of school-based health programs like the HSS that warrant tailored approaches that target these determinants to achieve high fidelity.</p>
                <p id="Par30">The overarching purpose of IMPROVE is to conduct a hybrid type 3 evaluation design to test the effects of bundled implementation strategies on the intervention fidelity of the HSS program while simultaneously monitoring effects on health outcomes of children and parents. There are two primary aims of IMPROVE: 1) To assess the comparative effectiveness of two bundles of implementation strategies (Basic and Enhanced) on the fidelity to the HSS program components; and 2) to monitor effects of the HSS program on child (diet and weight status) and parent outcomes (feeding practices and T2D risk). This study protocol follows the SPIRIT guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

Hybrid type 3 trials experimentally test the effects of implementation strategies on implementation outcomes while also gathering data on the effects on service recipient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The primary dependent variable will be fidelity to the HSS (implementation outcome). Using a hybrid type 3 design is advantageous when (a) there is a high momentum and mandate for implementation despite a somewhat limited evidence base, (b) effects are suspected to be vulnerable to a “voltage drop” when scaling up into routine practice, and c) the implementation strategies being tested are reasonably feasible in context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

                <p id="Par37">Eight municipalities in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, which had previously shown interest in the HSS program were contacted during the fall of 2020 to inquire about their willingness to take part in the IMPROVE study. Information meetings were held between the research team and key personnel such as central administrators and coordinators of school health care to create interest by explaining the rationale and background to the HSS. Two municipalities finally accepted this invitation after discussing it with their education administration. These municipalities had 110,000 and 50,000 inhabitants respectively, with mixed socioeconomy.</p>

Expert implementation support was offered as well as free training of school nurses in MI (at a value of ca. 1000 Euro per nurse) to incentivise participation in the study (implementation strategy 51: Improve implementer’s buy-in). The participating municipalities signed a memorandum of understanding with the research team that acknowledges their commitment to the study, and describes the role of each partner (strategy 31: Obtain formal commitments). All public primary schools in the municipalities with preschool classes were invited to participate in the study (<italic>n</italic> = 38). Online information meetings with all groups of involved school personnel were held in the spring of 2021 during which they were introduced by the research team to the HSS and the IMPROVE study and given the opportunity to ask questions. After this, school principals were formally asked if their school wanted to participate, which eight of them declined, mainly due to issues related to the covid-19 pandemic. Before the start of the study all involved school personnel will be asked to consent to be included in the study.</p>

During the first visit to the school nurse in pre-school class the child is accompanied by parents or guardians for a discussion regarding the school situation, the child’s overall well-being, relations with friends, possible health and learning problems, dietary habits and physical activity. The child’s height and weight is measured and compared to standardised growth curves. Eyesight and hearing are also tested. If a child is overweight, additional counselling should be offered including a follow-up. In case of obesity, the school doctor should become involved, and if necessary, the child has to be referred to medical specialists in child obesity for treatment in dialogue with school health care and parents.</p>

                <title>Development of IMPROVE</title>
                <p id="Par47">Development of the IMPROVE study was done in four steps from September 2020 to June 2021 in collaboration with stakeholders in the municipalities and guided by the implementation strategies in the SISTER taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Step 1: Exploring barriers and facilitators of implementation</title>
                  <p id="Par48">Exploration of context-specific implementation barriers and facilitators was based on previous process evaluations of the HSS program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and on two preparatory stakeholder workshops in each of the two municipalities participating in IMPROVE (Implementation strategy 1: Assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitators). The CFIR framework was used as a guiding determinant framework due to its multilevel structure and its applicability to the municipality setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The workshops were held digitally in each municipality due to the Covid-19 pandemic prohibiting in-person workshops. Workshop 1 for municipality 1 was held in November, 2020, with 17 participants (4 from the research team, 2 from primary health care, 2 school principals, 5 school nurses, 3 teachers, and 1 central manager) and lasted for 2.5 h. Workshop 1 for municipality 2 was held in January, 2021, with 18 participants (4 from the research team, 3 from primary health care, 4 school nurses, 1 teacher, 2 school principals, 2 meal staff, and 2 managers) and also lasted for 2.5 h. Each workshop started with the research team presenting the HSS program and the purpose of the IMPROVE study and participants could ask questions for clarification. Then, a brainstorming session was conducted using a virtual white board where participants individually or in small groups for 30 min could contribute “notes” on perceived implementation determinants of HSS in their municipality within five categories: the school, primary health care, the home, the municipality, and “other areas”. In total 42 notes were submitted in municipality 1 of which 15 were marked as a barrier, 5 as both a barrier and a facilitator and 22 as facilitators. In municipality 2, 35 notes were submitted of which 13 were marked as barriers and 22 as facilitators.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">After the first round of workshops, the research team coded the barriers and facilitators and grouped them according to the domains of CFIR. Two domains were added to the original CFIR framework: “Characteristics of intervention recipients” as already suggested by Barwick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and “Inner setting primary care”. The determinants of intervention recipients (parents) were identified based on the experience of school personnel and confirmed by information from previous qualitative studies with parents participating in the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The barriers and facilitators were then condensed by the research team into a list of more value-neutral implementation determinants in a consensus-based process. The determinants identified in the workshops were checked against previous process evaluations of the HSS intervention. In total 28 determinants were identified (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and exemplified by notes made during the workshops by the participants.

                  <p id="Par50">The determinants identified by stakeholders were discussed among the research team and preliminary strategies were mapped to these determinants through an internal consensus process (Strategy 17: Tailor strategies). The selection was also influenced by the work of Lyon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] who had described the most important and feasible strategies in the school context. In the second workshop in January (municipality 1) and February (municipality 2) with the same stakeholders, the implementation determinants identified in workshop 1 and the pre-selected strategies were presented. Stakeholders could then provide feedback based on their expertise and experience regarding the form and function of each strategy. No more strategies were added at this stage. After the stakeholder workshops, the scientific advisory panel was consulted to develop a final consensus on the most appropriate implementation strategies to use, which resulted in minor adjustments. The final selection of implementation strategies targeting the context-specific implementation determinants identified in Step 1 is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> (Basic). Based on our previous experience with the HSS program, these are regarded as a minimum to implement the HSS with reasonable fidelity in addition to first receiving formal commitment from the school principal.

                  <p id="Par53">Implementation of the HSS intervention will start with the school year 2021/2022 and include two cohorts of children and their parents. School nurses will undergo a 2-day MI training by trainers who are members of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT) and receive four supervisions (Strategy 39: Conduct ongoing training) in the spring and early fall of 2021. Lectures on relevant themes in public health will be made available on the project website, and new school staff will be trained continuously as needed. A manual will be made available for the school health team (Strategy 5: Develop a detailed implementation plan) describing the background to the HSS, the theoretical basis, goals, measures, outcomes, the time plan and strategies. Educational materials will be provided (Strategy 41: Develop educational materials) including the health information brochure, teacher’s manual, children’s workbook and other written materials to be used by the school personnel and placed on the project website. Fidelity indicators to the intervention components and instructions how to monitor them will be communicated through the manual (Strategy 7: Develop instruments to monitor and evaluate core components of new practice). A checklist to assess the quality of delivery of implementation strategies will be developed (Strategy 6: Develop and organise a quality monitoring system) and used yearly by the research team during schools visits (Strategy 9: Monitor the progress of implementation effort). An open online homepage will be made available with all information needed by different stakeholder groups and continuously updated with relevant information. School staff will be directed to this site for assistance with technical or practical questions (Strategy 11: Centralize technical assistance).</p>
                  <p id="Par54">After randomisation, schools allocated to group 2 will be introduced to the strategies in bundle 2 during a meeting with the research team. Each group 2 school will be offered a check-in to inquire about their progress and assist in problem solving. It will also be possible to ask questions via the website. Finally, efforts will be made to develop or identify an organisation that will be responsible for disseminating the program and support implementation (Strategy 75: Start a dissemination organisation). This will be based on stakeholder interviews and discussions with decision-makers.</p>

This information will be gathered through attendance logs, questionnaires answered by school staff and parents, and audio recordings of MI sessions. The primary outcome will be operationalized as an adherence score and a responsiveness score to the four intervention components. Adherence to three of the four components will be reported by parents and the nurse as yes/no. The classroom component will be reported by the teachers, and thus the score for this component will be the same for all children in the same class. The total adherence score will be from 0 to 4. Participant responsiveness measures how parents respond to and are engaged in the intervention and is measured on a scale from 1 to 5 (no appreciation to full appreciation) for each component with a total score of 4 to 20. Dose refers to exposure or the amount of the classroom component that has been delivered and received. This information will be obtained from the teachers who will use a logbook to report the proportion of teaching sessions performed, the proportion of lesson completion including length, and whether any adaptations and are made. Quality refers to the MI component. All MI sessions will be recorded and a random 10% of each nurses’ interviews will be coded for MI competence using the MITI protocol 4.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] by reliable coders.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par73">Many health promotion and prevention studies have been carried out in the school context around the world aiming to improve children’s dietary habits and increase physical activity and many lessons have been learned. The HSS parental support program builds on the growing evidence base of school-based health promotion programs. Thus far, HSS has been evaluated in three cluster-randomized trials during the past 10 years in Sweden including approximately 38 schools and 1000 families (33, 34, manuscript submitted). As a universal prevention program, the HSS reaches all children and parents across the socioeconomic and multicultural spectrum. The program is fully integrated into school routines and is moderately effective in improving dietary habits and physical activity in children and in one trial BMI in children with obesity was also reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Process evaluations have consistently shown that the program is well received among teachers, parents, children and school nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. For these reasons, the HSS program is well-positioned for implementation research that aims to develop and test strategies that facilitate its uptake and use as part of routine practice in the school setting.</p>
              <p id="Par74">The lack of evidence regarding the effect of strategies to improve implementation in the school context has been pointed out as well as the need for robust measures of implementation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In the Swedish context, IMPROVE is the first study to investigate the scaling up of an evidence-based family support program in primary school. It builds on well-established frameworks and models in implementation research such as CFIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Proctor’s outcome model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. IMPROVE is grounded in sound implementation methods as it emphasizes a systematic approach involving first the identification of context-specific determinants in tandem with stakeholders, and then tailoring strategies to tackle the identified determinants in an effective way. Using the SISTER taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this research will facilitate comparisons with other implementation studies in schools, both past and present. Finally, the use of a hybrid type 3 design is advantageous when there is a high momentum and mandate for implementation and the effects of the intervention are suspected to be vulnerable to a “voltage drop” when scaling up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par75">One barrier that is specifically addressed in IMPROVE is the engagement of parents. Low parental engagement has repeatedly been shown to be a challenge in previous evaluations of the HSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and in other similar programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In this study we aim to make additional efforts to engage parents by producing an attractive 5-min film explaining the purpose and content of the HSS to be watched at the first meeting in school. Also, by gaining approval of implementation of the program at the municipality level through a memorandum of understanding, school principals will be given a more prominent role as advocates of the program towards both school personnel and parents. We have also added an implementation strategy to improve the school environment, culture and climate around health, which in previous studies of the HSS has received criticisms from parents in some schools for not being health-promoting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The Enhanced strategy bundle consists mainly of monitoring and coaching by the research team. There is good evidence that external facilitation will lead to higher fidelity to the intervention components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The T2D component was added in a previous trial of the program to increase parent’s interest and involvement, but was unfortunately not successfully implemented. There is an ongoing discussion about the boundary between parents’ and schools’ responsibility when it comes to healthy eating and sufficient physical activity of school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The Swedish guideline for school health care does encourage schools to support parents however it does not specify how to do this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, the IMPROVE study can contribute to knowledge on how to increase engagement in health promotion from both parents and school personnel. From the start of developing this program the aim has been to <italic>begin with the end in mind</italic>, meaning that the program should be integrated into existing school routines and be scalable. This was achieved in the third wave of the program, where trained school nurses performed the MI components, as also in IMPROVE. The program is now fully compatible with school routines and in line with existing guidelines such as the curriculum, the guideline for school health care and national guidelines on the prevention of unhealthy behaviours recommending family support regarding children 6–12 years of age.</p>
              <p id="Par76">Key success strategies when scaling up school-based interventions have previously been identified by Milat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. These are the importance of systematic use of evidence, establishing monitoring and evaluation systems, calculation of cost, active engagement of the target community through a participatory approach, tailoring to the local context, infrastructure to support implementation, strong leadership and champions, political will, well defined scale-up strategy, and strong advocacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. We believe that the IMPROVE study has the potential to address most or all these key factors to successfully scale up the HSS program.</p>
              <p id="Par77">Fidelity is critical to understanding whether the failure of an intervention on client outcomes is attributable to inadequate implementation or intervention failure, or some combination thereof. In the IMPROVE study, we have developed a comprehensive measure of fidelity that will allow the exploration of the effect of implementation strategies on single intervention components and different dimensions of fidelity. Fidelity to both intervention components and implementation strategies will be measured as recommended by Slaughter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par78">What are the chances that IMPROVE will lead to the sustainment of the HSS program? Previous studies have shown that important factors for successful implementation are that the intervention has a relative advantage over other programs, that there is a tension for change, an established need in the target group, and available resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Relative advantage should be secured by the fact that no other evidence-based program in this area is available today in schools in Sweden. Tension for change among stakeholders has existed for many years given that childhood obesity and social inequalities are on the rise. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among 8–9-year-old children is around 22% and considerably higher in areas with low socioeconomic status in Sweden as elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, there is a higher prevalence and earlier onset of T2D in adults with low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. However, the question still remains whether the organisation, in this case, schools and primary care, are willing to collaborate in this endeavour, which will be tested in IMPROVE. If successful, the generalisability of this universal program is believed to be high, as it has been conducted in a great number of schools already in areas with low and mixed socioeconomic status, including families from different cultural backgrounds. The intervention components are flexible and can to a large extent be adapted to family needs.</p>
              <sec id="Sec36">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par79">There is no standardised operationalisation and methodology for measuring fidelity in school-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], which are often multi-component and multi-level interventions. In our previous studies of the HSS program, we considered MI performance and quality as a measure of fidelity, whilst observing the number of classroom sessions being performed. In IMPROVE, we have constructed a much more comprehensive fidelity measure. This measure includes 13 specific indicators covering the fidelity dimensions: adherence, dose, quality of delivery, and participant responsiveness to the four components, as well as two measures combining the four components. This will give us an opportunity to test the effect of the strategies on various aspects of fidelity to individual components and combinations thereof. However, these indicators need further validation which will be addressed during the study by e.g. observation of classroom lectures. Another limitation is that causal mechanisms on how implementation strategies work will not be studied as this was considered to be too demanding for school personnel. This could be the topic of future studies.</p>

              <p>LSE conceptualised the study in collaboration with CW, ÅN, NSS, SA, EP, EH, CC, SR and LK. ÅN was responsible for the fine-tuning of the HSS components and the MI training of school nurses. LSE, NSS, CW, SA and SR conducted the stakeholder workshops and summarised the identified implementation determinants. Based on the determinants, the implementation strategies were tailored and discussed in a consensus process between all authors. LSE drafted the manuscript with input from all authors who read and approved the final manuscript.</p>
