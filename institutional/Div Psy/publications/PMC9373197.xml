                  <title>Method:</title>
                  <p>An open trial analyzed data from 549 parents of children with ADHD aged 3 to
17 years, who participated in psychoeducation at an outpatient
habilitation/disability clinic. In all analyses, parents were stratified
into three symptom severity groups (low/middle/high) based on scores on an
ADHD screening scale.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Parental ADHD symptom severity was not associated with results on any
outcome, although the odds of having incomplete data were higher in parents
reporting higher symptom severity. Across the entire sample, we observed
high program completion rates, positive acceptability ratings and large
increases in parental knowledge.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Psychoeducation may be beneficial regardless of the participating parent’s
ADHD symptomatology. Further research is needed to examine whether these
results are generalizable to parents diagnosed with ADHD, an
underrepresented group in our study.</p>

            <p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disability characterized by a persistent pattern of
inattention, disorganization, and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that causes functional
impairment across most areas of life (<xref rid="bibr1-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr6-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Bölte et al., 2018</xref>). The
prevalence of this highly heritable condition (<xref rid="bibr33-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Nikolas &amp; Burt, 2010</xref>) has been estimated
at 5.9% in children (<xref rid="bibr49-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Willcutt,
2012</xref>) and 2.5% to 2.8% in adults (<xref rid="bibr18-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Fayyad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Simon et al., 2009</xref>). Multiplex families where
not only the child but also the parent(s) have ADHD symptoms, a description that applies
to 20% to 40% of families of children with ADHD (<xref rid="bibr42-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Starck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Takeda et al., 2010</xref>), might need additional
support by services or adaptations to facilitate active and beneficial participation in
recommended interventions (<xref rid="bibr26-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston
et al., 2012</xref>). A growing number of studies indicates that parental ADHD
symptoms may complicate the administration of and adherence to interventions for
children’s ADHD, ultimately increasing the risk of suboptimal treatment outcomes—whether
they be medication, parenting interventions (<xref rid="bibr9-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2017</xref>), or a combination
(<xref rid="bibr36-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al.,
2018</xref>). Considering the familial aggregation of ADHD (<xref rid="bibr15-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Epstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Uchida et al., 2021</xref>), it is important to find
out if this also applies to psychoeducation, that is, whether the clinical feasibility
and effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions targeting children’s ADHD differ
between parents with varying ADHD symptom severities. To the best of our knowledge, this
has not yet been studied.</p>
            <p>Treatment guidelines generally recommend that the assessment of children’s ADHD be
followed by structured information about the diagnosis and its treatment (<xref rid="bibr17-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Faraone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>). Children
are largely dependent upon their parents/caregivers to organize their treatment, and
psychoeducation on children’s ADHD is often directed at their parents. Such
parent-received psychoeducation typically seeks to increase parents’ knowledge about
ADHD (symptoms, behavioral manifestations, impairments, etiology), and its comorbidities
and treatment options. Additional objectives may include reducing unfavorable attitudes
toward the diagnosed child, increasing parents’ confidence in their ability to influence
their child’s situation, and providing a brief introduction to parenting strategies for
managing the child’s ADHD symptoms and behaviors (<xref rid="bibr13-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
            <p>The accessibility of an intervention has implications for its clinical feasibility,
including completion rates and program acceptability. Psychoeducation is most often
delivered in a standardized educational group format, where didactic lectures form a
central part (<xref rid="bibr13-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al.,
2020</xref>). Psychoeducational programs designed for adults with ADHD can yield
significant improvements in knowledge about ADHD (<xref rid="bibr23-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Hirvikoski et al., 2017</xref>). Participation does,
nevertheless, place high demands on cognitive capacities that are often challenged in
adults with ADHD; including inhibitory control, working memory and selective/sustained
attention, as well as the ability to memorize, sort, and prioritize provided
information. Relatedly, it has been suggested that adult ADHD symptoms may interfere
with participation in parenting interventions, for example by causing difficulties in
organizing treatment participation and assimilating program content (<xref rid="bibr9-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr26-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>).
Parents in multiplex families may also, by virtue of their own ADHD symptomatology, be
at increased risk for a range of psychosocial factors associated with poorer treatment
attendance and premature treatment termination (<xref rid="bibr34-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Nock &amp; Ferriter, 2005</xref>), including
socioeconomic disadvantage (<xref rid="bibr16-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Erskine
et al., 2016</xref>), co-occurring psychiatric conditions such as depression (<xref rid="bibr30-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Minde et al., 2003</xref>), and a
history of dropouts from educational or occupational engagements (<xref rid="bibr41-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Soendergaard et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
            <p>When it comes to the effects of parent-received psychoeducation, its positive role has
been supported across several trials (<xref rid="bibr13-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Montoya et al., 2011</xref>). The findings are,
however, neither easy to interpret nor consistent, as the format, scope, and outcomes of
the interventions vary considerably between studies (<xref rid="bibr13-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2020</xref>). Given common
conceptualizations of psychoeducation as a base and catalyst for the continued ADHD
treatment process, it is surprising that few studies include changes in knowledge about
ADHD among their outcomes (<xref rid="bibr3-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Bai et
al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al.,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Schoenfelder et
al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, parental ADHD knowledge seems to be of importance not
only for parents’ attitudes toward ADHD (<xref rid="bibr2-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Amiri et al., 2016</xref>), and available treatment
options (<xref rid="bibr12-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Corkum et al.,
1999</xref>), but also for their causal attributions about symptoms and behaviors
displayed by their ADHD child (<xref rid="bibr25-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp; Freeman, 2002</xref>). In line with calls to consider parents’
prerequisites, needs, and levels of parental stress when intervening with (their)
children’s ADHD (<xref rid="bibr8-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chacko et al.,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Theule et al.,
2013</xref>), it is important to find out how parents with high ADHD symptom
severity participate in and benefit from psychoeducation targeting their children’s
ADHD.</p>
            <p>The objective of this study was to examine whether the clinical feasibility (in terms of
completion rates and acceptability) and effectiveness of a parent-received
psychoeducational program on children’s ADHD differ between parents with varying ADHD
symptom severities. The program under study is widely implemented across Sweden, with
good clinical feasibility (<xref rid="bibr5-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Bölte et
al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Svanborg et
al., 2009</xref>). However, little is known about how it works for parents who
themselves have ADHD symptoms. Overall, it was hypothesized that parents with high ADHD
symptom severity would have lower program completion rates (primary feasibility outcome)
and benefit less than parents with low ADHD symptom severity, for example in terms of
parental knowledge gains (primary effectiveness outcome).</p>

with ADHD following procedures for a formal ADHD assessment (<xref rid="bibr32-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">National care program ADHD,

                <p>A total of 585 parents of children and adolescents with ADHD aged 3 to 17 years
were recruited from among families enrolling in the psychoeducational program
under study at the ADHD Center. Of these, the 549 participants (93.9%) that had
a complete baseline rating on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener
were included in further analyses (<xref rid="fig1-10870547221092120" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Of the 36 parents (6.2%) who
did not have a complete ASRS Screener, 4 had missed single items while 32
(88.9%) had not filled in the scale at all (reasons unknown). The ADHD diagnosis
of the child for whom the parent enrolled in psychoeducation (hereafter referred
to as the “target child”) was confirmed in accordance with the ADHD Center’s
clinical routines, by psychologists with access to the child’s medical health
records and reports. The study had no explicit exclusion criteria. However,
parents with a known intellectual disability and parents who were judged to
urgently need other kinds of treatment or support (e.g., due to a severe or
acute psychiatric condition) were referred to appropriate health care units and
interventions in accordance with the ADHD Center’s regular clinical procedures.
Parents of the same child were allowed to participate in the program and the
study at the same time.</p>

                <p>The recruitment period lasted between May 2017 and November 2019. The recruitment
procedure was further adapted at two occasions, due to clinical routine changes
at the ADHD Center and a low initial participation rate. Initially, all parents
who signed up for the program under study were invited to also participate in
its evaluation (n = 183, 33.3% of the study participants). Later, some (of
several parallel) program rounds were dedicated to the evaluation in such a way
that all parents who signed up for these particular course rounds also
participated in the study (n = 366, 66.7%). Parents recruited before and after
the routine changes did not differ in regard to their baseline ASRS Screener

                <p>The structured psychoeducational program under study is developed for parents of

designed to be accessible and helpful also for parents who themselves have ADHD
symptoms. The ADHD Center has since devoted substantial effort into further

(<xref rid="bibr28-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al.,

                  <p><bold>Knowledge quiz:</bold> The participants’ knowledge about ADHD,
treatment options, societal services, and parenting strategies (i.e., topics
covered by the program under study) was measured with a modified version of
an ADHD quiz (<xref rid="bibr7-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Bramham et
al., 2009</xref>). This 20-item quiz consisted of 17 statements (e.g.,
<italic toggle="yes">Children with ADHD also have deficient executive
functions</italic>) scored on a <italic toggle="yes">true</italic>-,
<italic toggle="yes">false</italic>-, or don’t <italic toggle="yes">know</italic>-scale and three
short-answer questions (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">What percentage of Swedish school-aged
children have an ADHD diagnosis</italic>?). Each correct answer was
assigned one credit, yielding a total sum score between 0 and 20. Higher
scores were taken to indicate more knowledge. When administered in the
current sample, the Knowledge Quiz was found to have good discriminant
properties, reaching a post intervention average item-difficulty of p = .75
(min p = .29, max p = .96), thus meeting the ≥ .75 threshold often set for
false/true tests (<xref rid="bibr11-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Cohen
&amp; Swerdlik, 2005</xref>). The internal consistency (as estimated
with the Kuder-Richardson 20 [KR<sub>20</sub>] formula, a dichotomous
equivalent to Cronbach’s alpha) of the Knowledge Quiz was KR<sub>20</sub> =
.63.</p>
                  <p><bold>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ):</bold> The general
behavioral symptoms and attributes of the participants’ target children were
measured with the extended version of the SDQ for parents of 4 to 17
year-olds (<xref rid="bibr21-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Goodman,
1997</xref>, <xref rid="bibr22-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The SDQ Total Difficulties Scale consists of 20 items
covering emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems,
and peer relationship problems. Responses are marked as <italic toggle="yes">not
true</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">somewhat true</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">certainly
true</italic> (scored 0, 1, and 2, respectively) and can be summed to
yield a total score between 0 and 40. The SDQ also comprises a five-item
prosocial behaviors subscale, with sum scores ranging from 0 to 10.
Moreover, the SDQ has an impact supplement that asks parents to rate the
extent to which their child’s difficulties cause distress or social
impairment: <italic toggle="yes">not at all</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">only a little</italic>,
<italic toggle="yes">quite a lot</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">a great deal</italic> (scored
0, 0, 1, and 2, respectively). When summed, this SDQ Impact Score ranges
from 0 to 10. Overall, higher scores indicate more difficulties (Total
Difficulties Scale), more prosocial behaviors (Prosocial Subscale), or more
everyday impairment (Impact Score). In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha
was <italic toggle="yes">rα</italic> = .68 for the Total Difficulties Scale,
<italic toggle="yes">rα</italic> = .73 for the Prosocial Subscale, and
<italic toggle="yes">rα</italic> = .72 for the Impact Score.</p>
                  <p><bold>The Parental Stress Scale (PSS):</bold> The participants’ levels of
parental stress were measured with the PSS (<xref rid="bibr4-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Berry &amp; Jones, 1995</xref>). The scale
consists of 18 statements (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">I feel overwhelmed by the
responsibility of being a parent</italic>) rated on a 5-point
Likert-type scale from 1 (<italic toggle="yes">strongly disagree</italic>) to 5
(<italic toggle="yes">strongly agree</italic>). Responses are summed to yield a total
PSS score between 18 and 90. Higher scores indicate higher levels of
parental stress. In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha was
<italic toggle="yes">rα</italic> = .84.</p>
                  <p><bold>Parental attributions (PA):</bold> The participants’ causal
attributions about undesired behaviors displayed by their target child were
measured with a modified version of the Written Analog Questionnaire (<xref rid="bibr24-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp; Freeman,
1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp; Ohan, 2005</xref>). The scale was altered to fit parents
of children with varying ages (3–17) and ADHD in different presentations,
both pre- and post-intervention. First, parents were asked to state which
behavior of their target child they currently perceived as the most
troublesome (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">does not listen; forgets things; gets outbursts,
reacts unexpectedly strongly; other</italic>). Next, parents were asked
to think about a situation where the stated behavior occurred in a typical
manner and rate their assumptions about its causes on six 10-point scales
from 1 to 10, addressing the following: the causal locus, the stability and
the globality of the behavior, the child’s degree of control over the
behavior, the intentionality of the behavior, and the parent’s
responsibility for the occurrence of the behavior. Then, parents were asked
to do the very same thing once again, while rating the assumed causes for
the second most troublesome behavior of their target child. In line with
previously published procedures (<xref rid="bibr24-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp; Freeman, 1997</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr27-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp;
Ohan, 2005</xref>), we combined the ratings of globality and stability
into a single score and averaged ratings across the firstly and the secondly
scored behaviors, yielding a single set of five PA dimensions 1 to 10. After
some reverse-scoring, higher scores were taken to indicate an attribution of
the child’s behavior as being <italic toggle="yes">more</italic> dispositional (internal
or stable/global), controllable or intentional, and of one’s own parental
responsibility for the occurrence of the behavior as being
<italic toggle="yes">lower.</italic> In the current sample, Spearman Brown split-half
coefficients were estimated to .50 for one of the two-item PA dimensions
(Controllability) and seen to vary between .62 and .67 for the others (PA
Stability/Globality, PA Locus, PA Intentionality, and PA Responsibility

                  <title>Missing data</title>
                  <p>The extent of missing data was substantial post intervention, which is why we
post hoc chose to analyze the potential associations between data
incompleteness and parental ADHD symptom severity. Scales missing ≤10% of
item scores were treated as complete after item-level imputation: missing
Knowledge Quiz items were replaced with a value (credit) of 0, while missing
SDQ and PSS items were replaced with the average of the respondent’s
observed items. Pairwise exclusion was used to handle scales missing &gt;10%
of items, as well as missing sociodemographic data.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Based on the assumption that adults with a positive ADHD screening are more
likely to experience impairment, we wanted to differentiate between parents who
reported high ADHD symptom severity (screening positively for ADHD) and parents
who did not. Accordingly, participants were stratified into groups corresponding
to the low, middle, and high strata defined by <xref rid="bibr28-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al. (2005)</xref>. For each ADHD
stratum, observed data was screened for accuracy, completeness, and fits with
assumptions of planned analyses. There were generally few outliers, and there
were no extreme values.</p>
                <p>The odds of completing the program were examined in a binary logistic regression,
using the ADHD strata variable as predictor. A series of one-way ANOVAs were
conducted to examine whether parents scoring in the low, middle, or high ADHD
strata differed in their ratings of lecture or program evaluations, or in terms
of baseline scores on the effectiveness-related measures. Significant effects
were further investigated using Tukey’s post hoc tests.</p>
                <p>The effectiveness-related outcomes were analyzed in a series of mixed ANOVAs
conducted with <italic toggle="yes">time</italic> (pre, post) as within-subjects factor and
<italic toggle="yes">group</italic> (low, middle, high ADHD strata) as between-subjects
factor. Due to the significant amount of missing data, the primary analyses were
performed per protocol (including only complete cases). They were then repeated
according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle (including program
completers as well as non-completers with pre-intervention data), with missing
values replaced using the last observation carried forward procedure. For the
sake of brevity, results from these secondary ITT analyses are reported in
detail only when they differ significantly from results obtained per protocol.
The same applies to the supplementary analyses in which parents’ and children’s
baseline medication status were included as covariates. Cohen’s
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> was interpreted as 0.20 = small, 0.50 = medium, and 0.80
= large (<xref rid="bibr10-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Cohen,
1988</xref>). Partial eta squared (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>)
was interpreted as .01 = small, .06 = moderate, and .14 = large (<xref rid="bibr10-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>
                <p>Finally, three binary logistic regression analyses were performed to examine if
the odds of having incomplete data differed between parents in the low, middle,
and high ADHD strata. Statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS
Statistics, version 26. Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> was calculated and one of the
figures was drawn in RStudio, version 1.4.1106.</p>

              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether a
parent-received psychoeducational program on children’s ADHD is as feasible and
effective for parents with high ADHD symptom severity as it is for parents with low
ADHD symptom severity. Across the total sample, this open trial revealed high
program completion rates, high program acceptability ratings and large increases in
parental knowledge about ADHD, its treatment, and parenting strategies. In addition,
we observed small positive changes in parents’ ratings of the everyday impact of
their target child’s behavioral symptoms, their levels of parental stress and their
causal attributions for their offspring’s behaviors. We did not, however, detect any
of the expected differences between parents with varying ADHD symptom severities —
either in program completion rates or regarding knowledge gains. Rather, the results
preliminarily indicated that most participants did benefit from the program under
study also in the context of parental ADHD symptoms. These results are encouraging,
as they suggest that parent-received psychoeducation delivered with general
adaptations to promote program accessibility for adults with ADHD may indeed have
the potential to be helpful for a large proportion of the families concerned. It
should be noted though, that the sample’s average ADHD symptom severity levels were
well below the clinical range and that the proportion of parents with a diagnosed
disability in the form of ADHD (4%) was much smaller than the expected 20% to 40%
(<xref rid="bibr42-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Starck et al.,
2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Takeda et al.,
2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>Looking first across the entire sample, the results regarding the clinical
feasibility and the informative utility of the psychoeducational program under study
were promising. When administered in its current outpatient habilitation services
context, including a range of inclusive practices to promote accessibility, no less
than 88% of the participants completed the program. Also in support of the program’s
clinical feasibility, the parents’ evaluations of its acceptability were noticeably
positive. In terms of program effectiveness, the findings were consistent with
previous observations of improvements in parental knowledge following
psychoeducation (<xref rid="bibr3-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al.,
2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Schoenfelder
et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to previous studies (<xref rid="bibr13-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2020</xref>), we also observed
reductions in the parents’ ratings of their target child’s behavioral symptoms, as
well as in their levels of parental stress. Although small, these reductions were
observed after no more than 5 weeks of psychoeducation, indicating that more
long-term follow-up measurements would have been of interest. Indeed, the search for
and coordination of the various health care interventions and services that children
with ADHD are entitled to do constitute a major, time-consuming stressor in many
Swedish families (<xref rid="bibr37-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Renhorn et
al., 2019</xref>). Theoretically, the psychoeducational provision of clear
information about treatment options and available support may contribute to
alleviating some of the pressure. Moreover, we observed small changes across a range
of parental causal attribution dimensions that may have implications for parental
responses to undesired behaviors on behalf of their child (<xref rid="bibr27-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp; Ohan, 2005</xref>) as well as
their likelihood of attending parent training interventions (<xref rid="bibr8-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chacko et al., 2017</xref>). Although preliminary,
these findings do suggest that the possibility of influencing parental causal
attributions is indeed worth further investigation (<xref rid="bibr27-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston &amp; Ohan, 2005</xref>).</p>
              <p>Contrary to what was hypothesized, the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of the
program under study did not differ between parents with varying ADHD symptom
severities. Instead, parents with high ADHD symptom severity were found to be as
likely to complete the program, submit positive program acceptability ratings, and
display knowledge gains as parents with low ADHD symptom severity. The main findings
of this study thus differ from previous research linking parental ADHD symptoms and
executive dysfunction to parenting- and treatment-related difficulties (<xref rid="bibr26-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr35-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr36-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al.,
2018</xref>), including less beneficial outcomes after other types of parenting
interventions (<xref rid="bibr9-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chronis-Tuscano
et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>First, based on these promising results, it seems that the overall accessibility of
the program under study may indeed be sufficient for a large proportion of parents
enrolling in psychoeducation at the ADHD Center. However, it remains unclear whether
these results would apply more generally, to psychoeducation delivered with fewer
adult ADHD adaptations or to a sample with other demographic characteristics.</p>
              <p>Second, it may be that parental ADHD symptoms do not influence psychoeducation
outcomes in a way that is comparable to how they seem to attenuate the effects of,
for example, parent training interventions (<xref rid="bibr9-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2017</xref>). For example,
while psychoeducation primarily provides information, parent training explicitly
asks parents to also implement and adhere to the newly acquired skills and
strategies at home. Indeed, <xref rid="bibr19-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al. (2020)</xref> recently found parental ADHD symptoms to be
associated with poorer skill utilization between parent training sessions, but not
with other treatment engagement aspects such as skill understanding, session
attendance, or treatment attitudes. The authors accordingly suggested that parental
ADHD symptoms have “the greatest effect on behaviors that parents must
self-initiate,” including for example skill-use (<xref rid="bibr19-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, future
studies should investigate the potential influence of parental ADHD symptoms on what
would ideally follow after psychoeducation, that is, parent-initiated translation of
the newly acquired knowledge into environmental modifications, use of new parenting
strategies and attempts to find, coordinate, and adhere to recommended interventions
and services (<xref rid="bibr9-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chronis-Tuscano et
al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Johnston
et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>Third, as is often the case in clinical research (<xref rid="bibr34-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Nock &amp; Ferriter, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), we
may have failed to reach and include a representative proportion of families with
more complex needs, who experience more treatment barriers. Indeed, parents in the
high ADHD stratum did report lower education, employment, and well-being, as well as
higher parental stress than parents in the low ADHD stratum (<xref rid="bibr17-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Faraone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Theule et al., 2011</xref>).
However, given the familial clustering of ADHD (<xref rid="bibr15-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Epstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Nikolas &amp; Burt, 2010</xref>),
we had expected the sample to encompass a significantly larger proportion of parents
diagnosed with ADHD than the observed 4%. Certainly, the proportion of participants
who reported high ADHD symptom severity (19.3%) was larger than that previously
observed in a Swedish general population sample (6.8% [<xref rid="bibr29-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Lundin et al., 2019</xref>]). However, an
inspection of the proportion of participants in the high ADHD stratum that had a
post-secondary education (42%) indicates that this group of parents was relatively
less impaired than, for example, a sample of adults with newly-diagnosed ADHD
identified in Swedish nationwide health registers (<xref rid="bibr20-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Argibay et al., 2021</xref>) and a
clinical sample of adults in psychoeducation for adults with ADHD (<xref rid="bibr23-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Hirvikoski et al., 2017</xref>).
Thus, despite performing this study at a regular outpatient habilitation service
center in which the program under study was a routine intervention, we may very well
have included too few parents with ADHD at clinically significant and impairing
levels to detect a possible association between parental ADHD symptomatology and
psychoeducation outcomes. Clinical experience suggests that parents who themselves
have disabilities such as ADHD are less likely to even enroll at care centers and
interventions (<xref rid="bibr5-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Bölte et al.,
2020</xref>). Probably, continued work is needed to improve accessibility and
generate intrinsic motivation for participation.</p>
              <sec id="section26-10870547221092120">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The results of this uncontrolled study should be read in the light of the
above-discussed limitations in sample representativeness, which do have
consequences for their generalizability to parents with diagnosed ADHD.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the amount of missing data was unevenly
distributed in such a way that a disproportionally large percentage of parents
with higher ADHD symptom severity had to be omitted from many analyses. This
pattern of missingness is not surprising given drop out and data incompleteness
rates in other clinical trials where adults with ADHD symptomatology participate
in interventions directed to themselves (<xref rid="bibr41-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Soendergaard et al., 2016</xref>) or
targeting their child’s ADHD (<xref rid="bibr36-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless,
it meant that we had to run the primary effectiveness-related analyses per
protocol. To enable supplementary ITT analyses, we used the last observation
carried forward procedure to replace missing values. This technique is
associated with a certain risk of bias but was judged to be the least
problematic given the observed pattern of missingness and the fact that this was
a pre-post study with only two measurement points, which caused problems using,
for example, linear mixed models to handle missing data. In addition, all
outcomes except completion rates were based on parental self-reports. Our
ability to detect potential between-strata differences in program acceptability
may have been reduced by ceiling effects, preventing discrimination between
parents clustering at high/positive evaluation scores. Additionally, parental
ADHD symptom severity was measured and defined solely based on the ASRS Screener
(<xref rid="bibr28-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al.,
2005</xref>). However, similar approaches have been used successfully by
most prior studies examining associations between parental ADHD symptomatology
and parenting intervention outcomes (<xref rid="bibr9-10870547221092120" ref-type="bibr">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2017</xref>). Finally,
we had no information about other or additional psychiatric condition(s) on
behalf of the participants, which is why this could not be accounted for in the
analyses. The same applies to information about which parents that participated
in the program and/or the study on behalf of the same target child, whose
ratings cannot be assumed fully independent.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our results indicate that parents with varying degrees of ADHD symptomatology,
including those with high symptom severity, may indeed benefit from parent-received
psychoeducation delivered with general adaptations to promote program accessibility
for adults with ADHD. Further research is needed to examine whether these results
can be generalized to parents with diagnosed ADHD and significant impairments in
everyday functioning, whose ADHD symptom burdens are higher than those observed
among parents in the current study.</p>
