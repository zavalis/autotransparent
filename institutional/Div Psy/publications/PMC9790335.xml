                <sec id="bjc12369-sec-0001">
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>The current study evaluated the feasibility of an internet‐delivered cognitive therapy (I‐CT) in a self‐help format with minimal therapist support for patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) with primary taboo obsessions. Specifically, the aims were to investigate (1) whether participants were able to grasp and apply the internet‐delivered cognitive framework to their own situation; (2) whether they had clinically meaningful reductions of OCD symptom severity; and (3) whether reduced negative appraisals (hypothesized mechanism of change in CT) preceded reductions in OCD symptom severity.</p>

                <sec id="bjc12369-sec-0002">
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Nineteen OCD patients with primary taboo obsessions, recruited from an OCD clinic or self‐referrals, received the I‐CT intervention for 10 weeks. I‐CT did not contain any systematic exposure or response prevention.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Adherence and engagement with the intervention was high. Most participants (<italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 13, 68%) understood and successfully applied the cognitive model to their own situation. Within‐group analyses showed large reductions in OCD symptom severity at post‐treatment (bootstrapped within group <italic toggle="no">d</italic> = 1.67 [95% CI; 0.67 to 2.66]) measured with the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale. The gains were maintained at the 6‐month follow‐up. Post‐hoc analyses revealed that the large reductions in OCD symptom severity were driven by the participants who understood the cognitive model. Reductions in negative appraisals predicted subsequent reductions in OCD symptom severity during treatment.</p>

                <sec id="bjc12369-sec-0004">
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>It is possible to adapt a purely cognitive intervention to a digital guided self‐help format and to achieve both cognitive change and meaningful symptom reduction. The results require confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent, chronic and impairing psychiatric disorder characterized by obsessions and compulsions (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Pérez‐Vigil et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Pérez‐Vigil et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Ruscio et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Skoog &amp; Skoog, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Amongst the most common kinds of obsessions are the so‐called ‘taboo obsessions’, which involve aggressive, sexual and/or religious thought content (e.g. fear of committing incest, paedophilia or wanting to harm a loved one; Bloch et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Brakoulias et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Pinto et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These obsessions are typically accompanied by checking rituals, mental compulsions and reassurance seeking (Cervin et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Leonard &amp; Riemann, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Williams et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) as well as higher levels of depression, shame and distress compared with the other kinds of obsessions (Brakoulias et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Glazier et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Grant et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Furthermore, a growing body of research has linked taboo obsessions with increased suicidality risk (e.g. Krebs et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Some studies have indicated that patients with taboo obsessions require extended treatment periods (Grant et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and/or may respond less well to standard psychological treatments based on exposure with response prevention (ERP; Alonso et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Mataix‐Cols et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Rufer et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Starcevic &amp; Brakoulias, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Williams et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Though the evidence is more limited, cognitive therapy (CT) is another form of psychological treatment that has been shown to be efficacious for OCD (Öst et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and might, at least in theory, be particularly well suited to treat taboo obsessions (Freeston et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Whittal et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wilhelm &amp; Steketee, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). CT is based on a cognitive theory which stipulates that the erroneous appraisal of intrusive thoughts plays a key causal role in the development of taboo obsessions. More specifically, appraising obsessions as immoral and personally significant is hypothesized to lead to elevated anxiety. For example, if a mother mistakenly interprets an unwanted thought to drown her infant as a sign that she is an evil person or that she is likely to perform such a behaviour, the thought itself will elicit high levels of distress. This elevated anxiety will in turn lead to thought suppression, which is hypothesized to fuel even more obsessions (Rachman, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Salkovskis, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). The main aim of CT for taboo obsessions is, therefore, to change these negative appraisals (e.g. ‘Having these thoughts is a sign that I'm an immoral person’) to more functional and realistic beliefs (e.g. ‘It's just a random thought and it doesn't say anything about me as a person’). Unlike ERP‐based treatments, CT does not involve any specific focus on exposure or habituation to aversive thoughts. Instead, the core focus is on making more nuanced interpretations and reducing the negative appraisals related to intrusive thoughts (Rachman, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Furthermore, CT may be associated with slightly lower drop‐out rates than ERP (11.4% vs. 19.1%; Öst et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and there are also data indicating that some therapists are hesitant about treating taboo obsessions with ERP (Gagné et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). CT could thus potentially serve as complementary intervention for patients who do not respond to or who are unwilling to engage in standard psychological treatment for OCD.</p>
              <p>CT for taboo obsessions is usually delivered in‐office by a highly trained therapist and is resource intensive, requiring somewhere between 12 and 24 therapy sessions (Freeston et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Whittal et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), posing significant barriers for dissemination. One way to increase the availability of this treatment could be to deliver it remotely in an online self‐help format with minimal therapist support (I‐CT). The current feasibility study was designed to address three key research questions:

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>This feasibility study included 19 adults with OCD and primary taboo obsessions. Inclusion criteria were defined as: (a) DSM‐5 (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) diagnosis of OCD with taboo obsessions as the most impairing symptom, (b) age ≥ 18 years, (c) living in Sweden, and (d) having provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) no informed consent, (b) not able to read the written material, (c) changes to pharmacological treatment that may affect OCD symptoms during the last month, (d) substance dependence during the last 6 months, (e) psychosis, (f) ongoing mania or hypomania, (g) suicidal risk that may affect study participation, (h) personality disorder that may significantly affect the treatment participation, (i) other ongoing psychological treatments that may affect OCD symptoms and/or (j) other primary psychiatric diagnosis.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>The study protocol was approved by the Swedish ethical review board (dnr 2019–06047) and was registered prior to the start of the trial on <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrails.gov" ext-link-type="uri">www.clinicaltrails.gov</ext-link> (NCT04313439). Recruitment took place between 26 March 2020 and 1 December 2020. The final data point was collected on the 11 August 2021.</p>
                <p>The majority of recruitment took place through the regular patient flow at a specialist clinic for OCD, Sweden. Participants could also self‐refer via the study webpage (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.tvangstankar.se" ext-link-type="uri">www.tvangstankar.se</ext-link>). Information about the study was distributed via the clinic and advertisements on social media. A total of 30 individuals showed interest in the study. Patients at the clinic were assessed face‐to‐face by a mental health professional in line with the clinic's regular routines, that is, this assessment was not a specific part of the study procedure. Individuals who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Eligible and interested patients were asked to log into a secure web platform, where written information about the study was provided including study objectives, benefits and possible risks associated with the study. Individuals who self‐referred via the study's webpage were provided the same written information. All individuals were asked to provide a digital written informed consent through the web platform and to fill out an online pre‐selection battery and general sociodemographic information (see ‘Measurements’ for more detail).</p>
                <p>All 30 interested individuals were contacted for a telephone interview to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. The interview included the clinician‐rated Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (Y‐BOCS; Goodman et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) for assessment of OCD symptom severity and the structured clinical interview Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 7.0.0 (M.I.N.I.) for assessment of comorbidity. The first author (KOL) conducted all assessments. Five individuals were excluded due to taboo obsessions not being their primary concern, and four were excluded due to primary psychiatric diagnoses other than OCD. One individual declined participation during the telephone interview.</p>
                <p>The remaining 20 individuals were included in the study after the telephone interview and completed the baseline assessment. After completion of the baseline assessment, the participants started the 10‐week I‐CT intervention. One participant was excluded just after enrolment in the study due to severe depressive symptoms and was referred back to the clinic. Eighteen participants (95%) completed the post‐treatment measurements (primary endpoint), and 15 participants (79%) completed the 6‐month follow‐up.</p>

                  <p>The therapists (KOL, KA and EA) were clinical psychologists with extensive experience in treating OCD and delivering online interventions. KOL and KA were supervised by EA, the principal investigator of the study. The therapists supported the participants throughout the intervention by regular email contact (e.g. minimum of two times/week) via the secure treatment platform and telephone if needed.</p>

A higher score indicates a higher level of severity (total range 0–40 points). The Y‐BOCS was administered by a clinical psychologist who was not involved in delivering the treatment. Participants who had at least 35% reduction in Y‐BOCS from pre‐treatment to post‐treatment and had a rating of 1 (‘very much improved’) or 2 (‘much improved’) on the Clinical Global Impression‐Improvement (CGI‐I) at post‐treatment were classified as treatment responders. Participants who had a score of ≤12 and a Clinical Global Impression‐Severity (CGI‐S) score of 1 (‘normal, not at all ill’) or 2 (‘borderline mentally ill’) were classified as being in remission (Mataix‐Cols et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>

                  <p>The participants completed all outcome measures prior to the intervention (week 0), at post‐treatment (week 10) and at the 6‐month follow‐up. Additionally, weekly measures were administered throughout the intervention period (week 1–9), which included the self‐rated version of the Y‐BOCS, the PSS and the Adverse events questionnaire. All participant‐rated measures were administered via the study's secure internet platform. Post‐treatment and follow‐up interviews were conducted by a clinical psychologist not involved in the treatment.</p>

                  <p>Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention (i.e. research question #1, <italic toggle="yes">Are participants able to grasp and apply internet‐delivered cognitive framework to their own situation?</italic>).</p>
                  <p>To address research question #2 (<italic toggle="yes">Is I‐CT associated with clinically meaningful reductions of OCD symptom severity?</italic>), we estimated the effects of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcome measures using a mixed‐effects regression framework. The model included a fixed effect of time and random intercepts with maximum likelihood estimations. Within‐group effect sizes were calculated using the m_effectsize script in Stata (freely available by typing ‘net install m_effectsize, from [<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.imm.ki.se/biostatistics/stata" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.imm.ki.se/biostatistics/stata</ext-link>] replace’ in Stata). This command estimates effect sizes by dividing the estimated change score in the mixed‐effects regression analysis by the pooled standard deviation at pre‐treatment. A 95% confidence interval around the effect size estimates was estimated by using 1000 bootstrap replications. A major advantage of this model is that it incorporates all measurement points and individuals in the effect size estimations. The regression model was repeated from post‐treatment to the 6‐month follow‐up in order to investigate whether the effects were sustained. All analyses evaluating the effects of the intervention were intention‐to‐treat.</p>
                  <p>To address research question #3 (<italic toggle="yes">Are reductions in OCD symptoms preceded by reduced negative appraisals (the hypothesized mechanism of change in CT?)</italic>, we employed a time‐lagged mixed‐effects regression analysis using weekly ratings on PSS as the independent variable (the indicator for negative appraisals) and the self‐rated Y‐BOCS as the dependent variable (week 0‐10 change score). In the main analysis, we investigated if PSS at week T predicted symptom levels measured with the self‐rated Y‐BOCS at week T+1. The model also included scores on self‐rated Y‐BOCS at week T as a covariate to control for symptom change. A sensitivity analysis with the reversed order of measures (i.e. whether score on the self‐rated Y‐BOCS at week T predicted the score on PSS week T+1, controlling for the score on PSS at week T) was also conducted.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>I‐CT is a 10‐week therapist‐guided online self‐help intervention. The intervention was mainly inspired by the book ‘The treatment of obsessions’ (Rachman, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The intervention has no ERP‐specific components. In line with a cognitive framework, the intervention includes components such as cognitive restructuring and behavioural experiments. It is divided into eight modules where each module contains brief text‐based chapters with interactive features such as worksheets. Some modules also include audio recordings of various exercises. A designated therapist had regular email contact with the participants within the encrypted platform. The participants were also able to reach the study personnel via telephone if needed. The content of each module is depicted in detail in Table <xref rid="bjc12369-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>

Hannes decide to test out whether low mood is associated with more negative appraisals. He records both mood and negative appraisals each hour during the week and finds a strong association. He writes the following in his online worksheet: ‘I interpret my obsession as “the truth” when I'm feeling depressed, and just as irrelevant thoughts when I'm feeling good. When I feel depressed, I cannot really believe my own interpretations. The focus should therefore rather be that I engage in anti‐depressive behaviours when I feel moody.

The therapists spent on average 119.8 minutes (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 77.1) per participant by responding to messages and homework assignments during the 10‐week period. The mean number of messages sent from the participants was 43.0 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 20.1), and the mean number of messages sent to the participant from the therapist was 37.8 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 28.3). Eighteen (95%) participants were actively engaged in the intervention material. One participant completed only the first module after which he/she did no longer engage with the intervention. One participant dropped out of the study after completing a 4 out of 8 modules. This particular participant felt stressed by the structured online format and wanted to receive face‐to‐face treatment instead. The 18 participants who actively engaged in the intervention material registered on average 5.7 (range 0–19) behavioural experiments during the course of the intervention.</p>

The reported adverse events were increased levels of anxiety (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4), increased levels of obsessions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3) and general stress (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1). One serious adverse event was registered in the current study: one participant was admitted to inpatient care for a couple of days during the intervention due to severe depressive symptoms. This participant continued working with the intervention during the study period and completed all modules. At the 6‐month follow‐up, 3 participants (16%) reported increased levels of anxiety (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2) and stress (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1). There were no reported serious adverse events at the 6‐month follow‐up.</p>

                  <p>Thirteen out of the 18 participants who engaged in I‐CT (72%) were assessed by the study therapists to have been able to understand and successfully apply the cognitive framework of taboo obsessions (participant examples are provided in Figure <xref rid="bjc12369-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Four of these 13 individuals requested extra telephone support (between 1 and 8 telephone calls per participant, around 5–15 min per call). The main reason for requesting extra support was a sudden increase in anxiety or depressive symptoms. Four of the participants who understood the cognitive model and responded to the treatment were categorized by the therapists in the clinical roundtable discussion as ‘therapy drifters’, meaning that they, beside taboo obsessions, to a large(r) degree addressed other psychiatric symptoms with the I‐CT framework, for example, excessive worry, health anxiety, depressive symptoms and traumatic memories.</p>
                  <p>All five participants who were deemed to not having been able to understand and apply the cognitive framework (see example in Figure <xref rid="bjc12369-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) received extra telephone support.

The intervention was associated with significant improvement in all secondary outcome measures, except on depressive symptoms (see Table <xref rid="bjc12369-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The gains on the primary outcome (Y‐BOCS) were sustained from post‐treatment to the 6‐month follow‐up (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = −1.70, <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = −0.90, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .366), as did gains on all secondary outcomes except a small decline on the PSWQ (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 2.29, <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> =  1.98, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .047) and the WSAS (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = −2.88, <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = −2.35, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>  = .019).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effects of a digital cognitive intervention for patients with taboo obsessions. The current study suggests that a therapist‐supported online cognitive intervention is both feasible and acceptable for individuals with OCD who struggle with taboo obsessions. Adherence and engagement during the I‐CT intervention was high, and a majority of the participants completed all eight modules. The participants were also highly engaged with their online therapist. About three quarters of the participants reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention and that they would recommend it to others. The reported adverse events were mostly mild and transient. Sixty‐eight per cent of the included individuals were deemed by independent raters to have understood and successfully applied the cognitive model of taboo obsessions to their own situation. Additionally, I‐CT was associated with clinically significant improvements in OCD symptom severity using the clinician‐rated Y‐BOCS (bootstrapped <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.67 [95% CI; 0.67 to 2.66]) with the majority of participants classified as responders and almost one third of the participants being in remission. These results are within the range of previous studies investigating in‐person CT for OCD in general (<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> = 2.21 [95% CI; 1.59 to 2.83]; Öst et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and in‐person CT for taboo obsessions in particular (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.76 [95% CI; 1.32 to 2.19]; Whittal et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The gains were sustained or further improved at the 6‐month follow‐up. Finally, the time‐lagged regression analysis indicated a unidirectional relationship whereby reductions in negative appraisals were associated with less severe OCD symptoms the subsequent week, providing further tentative support for the proposed mechanisms of change in CT.</p>
              <p>Traditionally, CT protocols for taboo obsessions require expert therapists and up to 24 1‐h face‐to‐face sessions (Freeston et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Whittal et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the current study, the therapist spent on average only 2 h per participant over the full study period of 10 weeks, while still achieving large effect sizes. The results are encouraging as they suggest that it is possible to translate a cognitive intervention to a digital guided self‐help format and to achieve both cognitive change and symptom reduction without having a face‐to‐face therapist in the same room engaging the patient in Socratic dialogue.</p>
              <p>Almost three quarters of the sample participants were assessed to have understood and successfully applied the cognitive model for obsessions to their own situation. Post‐hoc analyses indicated that the effect sizes in the intention‐to‐treat analysis were mainly driven by this subsample of participants who actually understood the model. Thus, the individuals who did not grasp the cognitive model and/or had difficulties to apply it to their own situation did not benefit from the treatment. The model was presented for the participants in the first intervention module and was repeated multiple times during the intervention (see Table <xref rid="bjc12369-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It is not clear why some participants understood the model, and why some did not, but it does not seem to be a question of compliance. Participants who were not able to successfully apply the cognitive model (example provided in Figure <xref rid="bjc12369-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) completed a similar number of modules. The higher degree of therapist support that was provided via telephone to these participants did not seem to give any incremental effects. Hence, it is not clear if it was the online mode of treatment delivery, the written material or possibly clinical characteristics of the participants that could explain these results. While likely underpowered, the data from this analysis are clinically important as it suggests that it is possible to detect high‐risk individuals at an early stage of treatment. Future research should investigate this issue further. Additionally, future research should investigate whether it is possible to increase the proportion of individuals understanding and applying the cognitive model to their own situation. This could be done, for example, by using videos or even more detailed case descriptions.</p>

              <p>If the encouraging results of this trial are confirmed in controlled trials, what role could I‐CT play in the future? One idea would be to use this intervention as a complementary treatment to individuals who may be reluctant to engage in exposure‐based therapies or to patients who do not respond to ERP‐based treatments. Another possible approach could be to make I‐CT completely self‐guided and develop formats to reach also the wider population of individuals who struggle with taboo obsessions but do not necessarily fulfil diagnostic criteria for OCD. Individuals with subthreshold levels of OCD have comparable levels of functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity as patients with full‐blown OCD (de Bruijn et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Fullana et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). One specific population which is known to struggle with taboo obsessions are new parents (Abramowitz et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Fairbrother et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Fairbrother &amp; Woody, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lawrence et al., <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is possible that a completely self‐guided easy‐to‐access online intervention could help these individuals at a time when traditional treatment may be difficult for them to access due to time constraints.</p>

              <title>LIMITATIONS</title>
              <p>There are limitations to this study that affect the interpretation of the results. First and foremost, the sample size was small and the study did not include a control group. Therefore, the estimated effect sizes should be interpreted with caution and need to be replicated in a randomized controlled trial that includes a credible comparator. Second, the majority of the participants were females (74%), possibly limiting generalizability to other populations. Third, the study design did not allow for a full mediator analysis, nor a mechanistic test, to investigate the possible relationship between a reduction of negative appraisals and subsequent reductions in OCD symptom severity. Forth, the assessors were not blinded to treatment allocation, which could potentially bias the results and increase the risk of type I errors. Future trials should use extensive blinding procedures to avoid these risks (Mataix‐Cols &amp; Andersson, <xref rid="bjc12369-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>This feasibility study showed that it is possible to successfully adapt a purely cognitive intervention to a digital guided self‐help format and to achieve both cognitive change and meaningful symptom reduction. The results require confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.</p>
