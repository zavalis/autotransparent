                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) to antibiotics are common and a substantial issue in managing patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical features as well as risk factors of DHR to antibiotics in CF.</p>

                <sec id="bcp15434-sec-0002">
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>A 20‐year retrospective study was conducted among 226 CF patients (100 children and 126 adults) attending our centre. The Swedish Registry for Cystic Fibrosis and electronic medical records enabled us to ascertain the number and routes of antibiotic courses. All suspected DHR were evaluated.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The patients had a total of 16 910 antibiotic courses, of which 6832 (40%) were intravenously administered. Of 226 enrolled CF patients, 70 (31%) developed overall 131 DHR to antibiotics. The prevalence of DHR increased with advancing age (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001). Beta‐lactams elicited 71% of all DHR and piperacillin was the most common single culprit (30% of intravenous and 24% of all DHR). Reactions were mild to moderate and mostly limited to skin; no severe cutaneous adverse reactions were observed. Additionally, anaphylaxis was rare, constituting 2.3% (3/131) of all DHR. Patients with DHR were exposed to significantly more courses of antibiotics than those without DHR (median 124 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 46, retrospectively, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>DHR to antibiotics, particularly to beta‐lactams, are increased in CF patients, and associated with a higher number of cumulative exposures because of recurrent infections. However, severe cutaneous or systemic DHR, such as anaphylaxis, appear to be rare.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) to antibiotics are a substantial problem. Annually, on the basis of 6614 cases, 142 505 visits were estimated to US emergency departments because of drug‐related adverse events to antibiotics,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> most of them to beta‐lactams. In contrast to predictable adverse drug events due to their pharmacological side effects, DHR mostly consist of either immediate pruritus, urticaria, vomiting, dyspnoea, hypotension and anaphylaxis or non‐immediate exanthems of different severities. Although DHR, particularly to beta‐lactam antibiotics, are self‐reported both in adults and children with a prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> in only about 10% of these cases can this suspicion be confirmed by allergy diagnostics.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Females have higher allergy incidence rates for antibiotics and there is a steady increase in antibiotic allergy prevalence with ageing.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, inherited disease with recurrent pulmonary exacerbations. Therefore, these patients frequently require 10 or 14‐day courses of antibiotics for suppression of chronic infection with organisms such as <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>). The intravenous treatment consists of two medications: often beta‐lactams (ceftazidime, piperacillin, meropenem or aztreonam) in combination with aminoglycosides (most often tobramycin) or colistimethate sodium.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>DHR to parenteral antibiotics have been reported to occur in up to 20–60% of antibiotic courses in CF patients.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> More recently, studies have suggested lower prevalence, because not all patients with assumed DHR were confirmed by allergy testing and/or drug challenge.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> However, allergy evaluation is not routinely applied in CF patients with suspected DHR due to the high number of patients cared for in cystic fibrosis centres and patients needing immediate treatment not allowing allergy testing first.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Therefore, there is a risk for mislabelling predictable adverse drug events as DHR<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and performing desensitizations in these patients<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> if reactions are not recorded properly and assessed by allergists. In the current study, we had the opportunity to assess the prevalence of DHR to antibiotics in the largest studied cohort of both CF patients and cumulative antibiotic exposures. The cohort was well‐characterized due to continuous electronic file records as well as assessment of the recorded reactions by two independent allergists. Further, we evaluated the risk factors and clinical features of reported DHR.</p>

                <title>Study population and study design</title>
                <p>The Swedish CF Registry was established in 1992 and contains annually updated data on broad characteristics of the CF patients in Sweden. Please see the following link for the exact data recorded in the Registry: <ext-link xlink:href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fcf-registret.se%2Fonewebmedia%2FVariabellista_cfregistret.xlsx%26wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" ext-link-type="uri">Variabellista_cfregistret.xlsx (live.com</ext-link>). The CF Registry has enrolled 733 patients as of 31 December 2018. Of these, 258 attending the Stockholm CF Center (SCFC) between 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2018 were identified and invited to participate in a 20‐year retrospective study. Of these, 226 CF patients gave their written consent and were enrolled in the study (Figure <xref rid="bcp15434-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The study was approved by the Regional Ethic Committee of Stockholm (Dnr: 2019–00109).</p>

                <p>Adverse antibiotic reactions (AAR) were defined as all reported unexpected events that occurred during antibiotic courses, which required a subsequent medical intervention, or such combination of symptoms requiring administration of antihistamines and/or corticosteroids and/or adrenaline and discontinuation or change of antibiotic treatment. A DHR was diagnosed if symptoms were typical of an immediate or delayed‐type hypersensitivity, such as urticaria, anaphylaxis or exanthem as described.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Excluded reactions consisted of unspecific symptoms such as isolated fever, headache, malaise, joint pain without swelling. In certain cases, it was difficult to distinguish AAR from DHR. Therefore, we evaluated on a case‐by‐case basis. For instance, facial tingling was included when described as itchy sensation/numbness under the skin or in the mouth and lips. However, tingling in fingers and feet mimicking paraesthesia was not included as it may be an adverse reaction in patients exposed to colistimethate. Moreover, isolated fever that occurred mostly during the first 2–3 days of courses was also excluded, hypothetically considered more likely to be an expression of Jarish Herxheimer reaction rather than drug‐induced fever, which most often occurs towards the end of the course.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Thus, DHR was limited to type l and type lV‐mediated reactions in this study.</p>
                <p>The data were collected both from the CF patient registry and medical records. The following data were retrieved from the CF Registry for this study: demographics, presence and duration of <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐colonization as of 31 December 2018 (defined according to modified Leeds criteria and/or significantly raised anti‐pseudomonas antibodies as defined by the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry),<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and number of antibiotic courses (in total and per year both for oral and intravenous administrations) as of 31 December 2018. In addition, data regarding AAR were collected from the medical records at the time of chart review (31 December 2018). Afterwards, all AAR data was retrospectively evaluated by two experienced allergists (A.K. and T.G.) and patients with possible DHR were identified. Moreover, DHR, with regard to parenteral antibiotic courses, were documented in detail including the date of onset relative to the day of the antibiotic treatment course, the onset of the reaction in relation to administration of the infusion, type of symptoms, treatment of the reaction, and change or discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. Oral antibiotic treatments were included whenever sufficient documentation was available.</p>
                <p>A more detailed review of the medical records was performed for individuals with possible antibiotic‐induced anaphylaxis by two experienced allergists (A.K. and T.G.) to ensure that anaphylaxis diagnosis was supported by clinical findings and fulfilled the current criteria for anaphylaxis.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The information included details of anaphylaxis history, presence of atopy, additional reactions to antibiotics, and administered therapy during the anaphylactic episode.</p>
                <p>Further, reactions that occurred during intravenous treatment were classified according to the time interval between the first drug administration and their onset,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> as “immediate” (when they occurred within the first hour) or “nonimmediate” (when occurred after the first hour). Also, we used a modified classification for nonimmediate reactions by subdividing these reactions into “early” (accelerated) (when occurring &gt;1 to ≤24 hours after the commencement of a specific course) and “late” when reactions occurred after 24 hours.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>

                <p>For all statistical analyses, we used R 4.0.2 (The R Project for Statistical Computing, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were presented as median and range. Because the distribution of these data was not normal, group differences were analysed using the Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>‐test for continuous variables and Chi‐square test for categorical variables. All tests were performed using a level of significance of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05. The logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between a history of DHR and potential risk factors.</p>

                <p>Piperacillin was responsible for the highest number of reactions (31 DHR), corresponding to 24% of all DHR and 30% of the intravenous DHR, followed by ceftazidime (22 DHR, 17% and 21%, respectively), colistimethate (18 DHR, 14% and 17%, respectively) and meropenem (17 DHR, 13% and 16%, respectively) (Figure <xref rid="bcp15434-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Notably, beta‐lactams as a class were responsible for 71% (93 DHR) of overall and 81% (84 DHR) of all parenteral courses. Regarding oral antibiotic courses, cotrimoxazole was the most common drug eliciting DHR (13 reactions and 48% of all oral antibiotics), followed by amoxicillin (four reactions, 15% of oral antibiotics) and ciprofloxacin (three reactions, 11% of oral antibiotics). All 27 DHR presented with cutaneous symptoms; mostly exanthema (12 DHR), followed by angioedema (9 DHR), urticaria (5 DHR), pruritus (5 DHR) and flushing (4 DHR). Notably, certain reactions exhibited multiple skin symptoms. Time for onset was available only for 14 DHR, all nonimmediate, occurring usually after some days. No anaphylaxis was observed during oral antibiotic courses.</p>

                <title>Risk factor analysis</title>
                <p>The odds for DHR were found to be 5.8 times higher with intravenous antibiotics compared to oral courses. Further, comparisons between patients with and without history of DHR are shown in Table <xref rid="bcp15434-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Overall, higher cumulative number of antibiotics courses, increasing age as well as longer period of time with <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐colonization were identified as risk factors in univariate analyses. In contrast, the status of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and gender were not significantly different between patients with DHR and those without. Moreover, when we performed logistic regression analyses, we found the cumulative numbers of intravenous antibiotic courses to be the most significant predictor for the development of DHR. This is because both age as of 31 December 2018 and time with <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐colonization had quite strong associations with number of intravenous antibiotic courses (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.50, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.68, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). Compared with the univariate effect, the logistic effect of standardized age on history of DHR decreased from β = 0.91 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001) to β = 0.36 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .08) when adjusting for number of intravenous antibiotic courses. The corresponding values for time with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>a‐colonization was a decrease from β = 0.84 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .001) to β = 0.47 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .14). This suggests that number of intravenous antibiotic courses accounted for approximately 60% and 44% of the associations between history of DHR and age and time with <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐colonization, respectively.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Hypersensitivity reactions to antibiotics in CF patients generate a significant clinical problem, as they appear to be more frequent than in the general population. Here, we conducted a 20‐year retrospective study at a single tertiary care centre evaluating the prevalence and clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions to antibiotics by screening 16 910 courses in 226 CF patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest studied cohort of CF patients so far.</p>
              <p>We found an overall prevalence of DHR of 31% in the current study. This appears to be higher when compared to a population‐based study reporting an overall rate of antibiotic allergy to be 15.3%.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, the number of courses was higher in CF patients and that was significantly associated with the development of DHR. Interestingly, however, the reaction rate per antibiotic course was 0.77% (1 in 129 courses) in the cohort. This does not appear fundamentally different from a population‐based study showing the rate of DHR to oral penicillin of 0.60% and parenteral penicillin courses of 0.77%.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Notably, most reactions were mild and limited to skin, as severe cutaneous and immediate systemic allergic reactions, i.e., anaphylaxis, were infrequent in this cohort.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the prevalence of DHR was in line with the previous cohort studies analysing antibiotic hypersensitivity in CF patients: 29% in Pleasants et al.,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> 34% in Wills et al.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and 36% in Burrows et al.,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> but lower than Roehmel et al. (60%)<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and Koch et al. (62%).<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The great variation in reports might be due to the criteria applied for hypersensitivity and design of study. For instance, the study by Koch et al. included only patients with chronic <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐infection, which were about half of all patients<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and the study by Roehmel et al. enrolled only patients who had at least four intravenous antibiotic courses,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> which might have led to selection bias. Further, some studies included both children and adults, whereas others included mostly adult patients. In our study, we had almost as many children (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 100) as adults (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 126). In addition, most previous studies described DHR to intravenous beta‐lactams; however, in the present study, we analysed DHR to all kinds of antibiotics used both in intravenous and oral courses.</p>
              <p>The majority of DHR in the current study were limited to the skin and the severity of reactions were mild to moderate. Notably, none of the patients in our cohort had a severe cutaneous adverse reaction including Stevens–Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). Although these reactions have been described in CF patients,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> they appear to be as uncommon as in the normal population. Likewise, severe immediate DHR were rare, as anaphylaxis was only present in three DHR (2.3%). By contrast, the previous studies by Koch et al.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and Roehmel et al.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> reported much higher anaphylaxis rates of 5.6% and 15%, respectively. Nevertheless, our overall observation, in line with other studies, supports the notion that anaphylactic reactions are rare in CF,<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> since we observed only three anaphylactic reactions in 16 910 documented antibiotic courses. Moreover, anaphylactic reactions in our study were caused by piperacillin, meropenem and colistimethate. To the best of our knowledge, colistimethate has not been previously reported in anaphylactic reactions in CF patients, as most previous studies only analysed DHR to beta‐lactams. Interestingly, no anaphylaxis was observed during oral antibiotic courses. Although patients with anaphylaxis experienced DHR to other antibiotics as well, no additional anaphylaxis was reported. Moreover, when we compared the anaphylaxis rate to the population studies, the results were of interest. The reaction rate of anaphylaxis was 0.017% (1 in 5637 of total courses) in the cohort, which appears to be higher than in the normal population. For instance, a large population‐based study reported 1 oral penicillin‐associated anaphylaxis in 255 320 courses and 1 parenteral penicillin‐associated anaphylaxis in 123 792 courses.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Likewise, oral and parenteral cephalosporin‐associated anaphylaxis in the general population were reported to be 1 in 180 381 and 1 in 60 953 courses, respectively.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Thus, we can suggest that the rate of antibiotic‐induced anaphylaxis is increased in CF.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, 79% of all DHR occurred during parenteral antibiotic courses (104/6832 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 27/10 078 oral antibiotic courses; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001) indicating that this route of exposure or higher drug dosage may be associated with an increased risk for DHR.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Another factor which might contribute is that these reactions were documented more accurately. Among the culprit antibiotics, piperacillin was the most common causing 30% of intravenous and 24% of all DHR as in line with the previous reports.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> This was followed by ceftazidime, colistimethate and meropenem. Of note, beta‐lactams were responsible for 71% (93 DHR) overall and 81% (84 DHR) of the parenteral courses, which is in line with another study (79%)<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and may reflect the frequency of beta‐lactam use in the respective centres.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Moreover, 43% of patients experienced DHR to more than two antibiotics (Figure <xref rid="bcp15434-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), which is similar to data in the literature.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Notably, the most common oral antibiotic eliciting DHR was cotrimoxazole (48% of oral antibiotic DHR).</p>
              <p>About half of the DHR with intravenous courses were observed during the first 24 hours, as 28% occurred during the first hour and 19% within 1–24 hours. However, 48% of all DHR were delayed, presenting on Day 2 or later, which was somewhat lower than previous studies.<xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="bcp15434-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Notably, all anaphylactic reactions occurred immediately, i.e., within the first hour of infusion, suggesting a possible IgE‐mediated mechanism. Milder DHR, such as urticaria, flushing and angioedema presented both as early and as late reactions. Conversely, pruritus, exanthema and tingling were more common on the second day or later during treatment, typical for a delayed type hypersensitivity (Figure <xref rid="bcp15434-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Hence, this data suggests that the start of parenteral antibiotic treatment in CF patients should preferably be initiated at hospital to make sure safety aspects, whereas later dosages can be given on an outpatient basis.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown inconsistent results regarding potential risk factors for DHR in patients with CF. In the current study, we found a higher prevalence of DHR with increasing age, a longer period of time with <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐colonization and a higher number of cumulative exposures to antibiotics. However, multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that a big portion of the univariate associations between history of DHR and age and time with <italic toggle="yes">Pa</italic>‐colonization could be accounted for by number of intravenous antibiotic courses. Thus, a higher number of cumulative exposures to antibiotics appears to be the most significant risk factor for developing DHR. Moreover, no associations between CFTR genotype, gender and the risk of DHR were found.</p>
              <p>The main strength of this single‐centre study was that we had the opportunity to assess the prevalence of DHR in the largest studied cohort of CF patients by screening 16 910 antibiotic courses. The cohort was well characterized due to continuous electronic file records as well as retrospective assessment of the recorded reactions by two independent allergists. Thus, the risk for data to be missed due to recall bias was clearly reduced in comparison to other studies. Conversely, its major limitation was the retrospective nature of the study. Details of the timing and symptoms of DHR to oral antibiotic courses were not always accurately documented as often reported by patients.</p>
              <p>In addition, lack of confirmatory allergy testing should also be mentioned as a limitation in this study. However, considering the high number of patients affected, it is not always possible in clinical practice to systematically perform allergy work‐up and/or drug provocation tests to confirm the diagnosis. In the present study, two allergists independently re‐evaluated the reported reactions and assessed their likelihood of being a true DHR. Non‐specific manifestations were excluded from the analysis, such as anxiety, flushing, pain, fever, if they rather presented an infectious, toxic or somatoform reaction. Although DHR in individual cases cannot be fully ruled out without allergy tests, the prevalence reported in this study should be more accurate than that from previous studies, in which not all reported reactions were reviewed by allergists.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients with CF have an increased risk for DHR, which is highly associated with the number of cumulative exposures to antibiotics. However, the severity of most reactions was mild and limited to skin, as anaphylaxis was rare. Considering a substantial increase in the life expectancy and growing number of adult patients, there is apparently an unmet need to improve care of CF patients. Although not generally feasible in the clinical routine, systematic allergy work‐up to confirm DHR with a compatible history may therefore be instrumental to avoid overdiagnosis and to achieve further improvement in the management of CF patients.</p>
