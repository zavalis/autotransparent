Dr Holmes was supported by a Wellcome Trust Clinical Fellowship (088217). Finally, some of the caveats in interpreting the results of this study should be acknowledged. We have suggested that our results may have clinical implications; however, extrapolating these laboratory results to the clinic requires two assumptions. First, it assumes that the degree of affective bias change induced by a treatment is a reasonable proxy for the clinical efficacy of that treatment, and second, it assumes that the cognitive effects of the interventions demonstrated in this study of healthy volunteers are an accurate reflection of their effects in clinical populations. Support for these assumptions is provided by previous work, which has demonstrated that the initial effects of antidepressants on affective bias predict later clinical response () and by the similarity between the effects of the treatments on affective biases in non-clinical and clinical populations (, ). Furthermore, the finding that the cognitive effects of citalopram predicted its protective effect during the mood induction task supports a link between affective bias and subjective mood. However, a more direct test of these assumptions would obviously be provided by replicating the current findings in a clinical sample. A second caveat is that the stability and persistence of any cognitive bias training is likely to be influenced both by the reliability of the measures of cognitive bias (see  and ) and by the variability in the induced bias itself (; ). As our study was designed to test the immediate impact of interventions on cognitive functioning and mood reactivity, we did not assess the degree to which the induced biases persisted and remained stable after completion of the treatment. Future studies may be able to address this limitation by retesting the effects of the treatments at later time points. Third, we monitored compliance with the pharmacological aspect of treatment using participants' self-report only. It would have been reassuring also to have access to serum citalopram levels to objectively confirm compliance. Fourth, we did not collect detailed information on participants' family history of depression. Given the previous finding that this factor is associated with more pronounced negative mood effects of tryptophan depletion (), it would be interesting to investigate whether it also mediated the protective effects of citalopram found during the mood induction task. Finally, it should also be acknowledged that the sample sizes used in the study were relatively modest. Thus, although the study was able to identify significant interactions between the two treatments, other treatment effects may not have been detected because of insufficient power."

Given the power analysis in the planning phase of the study, a randomization list for 280 participants was prepared. Due to limited resources and time, as well as difficulties recruiting families because of a large number of ongoing parent training studies in Gothenburg, the recruitment (from March 2011 to April 2013) was stopped after including 231 families, which resulted in an uneven number of families in the conditions (FCU: N = 122, iComet: N = 109). We obtained data from 231 parents, 200 children and 203 teachers at the initial assessment. Despite the uneven numbers of families in the conditions, we found no significant differences or mentionable effect sizes between the conditions on any demographic or baseline measures. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board in Uppsala (Dnr. 2010/119), and it also was registered at ISRCTN registry, DOI: 10.1186/ISRCTN09352710 (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN09352710. 4/1/ 2013). The research was run in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Swedish Research Council, which mirror those of the American Psychological Association (APA) ethics code. In accordance with criteria and suggestions provided in many reports e.g.,, the study is characterized as an effectiveness trial. Therapists in regular social services conducted the FCU, there were few exclusion criteria, and the FCU is inherently flexible for adaptations to the needs of the families. It means that some families go on with additional interventions after the check-up, while other families do not receive any further intervention. In addition, one goal was to investigate the subjective outcomes in real-world settings from different perspectives (parents, children and teachers).",True,Competing Interests The authors declare no competing interests.,True,"The authors wish to thank all the participants (children, adolescents, parents, and teachers), all the family therapists, facilitators, supervisors, and research assistants, as well as the study coordinator Jenny Thunberg.

However, little is known regarding the economic efficiency of this additive effect. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out in Sweden including 120 children aged 8–12 who screened positive for disruptive behaviour disorders, within a psychiatric care setting, and their parents. They were randomly assigned to either the Swedish group-based PMT Comet, or to an enhanced version, where an additional child component was provided, the Coping Power Programme (CPP). Child behaviour problems as well as healthcare and educational resource use were measured at baseline, post-test and at two-year follow-up. A net benefit regression framework was used to estimate differences in costs and health outcomes between the two intervention arms during the two-year period. Comet with CPP cost on average 820 EURO more per family than Comet only. At the 2-year follow-up, there were 37% recovered cases of ODD in Comet with CPP, in comparison to 26% in the Comet only arm. At a willingness-to-pay of approximately 62,300 EURO per recovered case of ODD, Comet with CPP yielded positive net benefits, in comparison to Comet only. Offering children the CPP simultaneously as their parents receive PMT, in comparison to only providing PMT, yields clinically relevant gains. Despite the relatively small cost for CPP, investment in combining PMT and CPP should be guided by resource prioritisation.

The funding agencies were not involved in study design, data collection, analyses, data interpretation or the reporting of the study. Conflicts of interest: None declared. Key pointsThis study advances understanding of structural stigma’s association with mental health by taking advantage of the divergent structural stigma climates experienced by sexual minority male migrants.The study specifically finds that structural stigma is associated with rejection sensitivity, internalized homophobia and poor mental health as a function of sexual minority men’s length of exposure to structural stigma in their countries of origin.Findings suggest that improving structural climates for sexual minorities may be an effective means to reduce the mental toll of minority stress."
